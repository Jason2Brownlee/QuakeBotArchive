# Quake Bot Genealogy

Estimated quake bot genealogy.

The plot below shows the genealogy of Quake 1 bots where each bot is connected to a single prior project. This was estimated from the documentation and source code.

Many bots draw on ideas and code from more than one other bot project, and this cannot be shown given the limitations of the mind mapping software. Also, bot mods may draw ideas from non-bot projects, which is not shown.
