QuakeBot v1.1
-------------
This mod is an improvement over the original ReaperBot v0.81 . The impulses
and basic command set is similar to the ReaperBot's. Unzip this archive with 
the pkzip switch "-d" (restore directory structure) into C:\QUAKE\QBOT and
run it with the following command line:

quake.exe -winmem 16 -listen 16 -game qbot


Added Features
--------------
. Reaperbot silent jumping bug fixed.
. Reaperbot thud sound when landing fixed.
. Reaperbot dissappearing weapon bug fixed.
. Reaperbot names and skill designation convention changed.
. Reaperbot spawned in teamplay mode have random team colors.
. Reaperbot spawned in deathmatch have different shirt and pants colors.
. Realistic bot-vision implemented.
. Realistic bot-player-physics implemented.
. True observer mode implemented.
. Scores appear on ranking screen.
. Deathmatch 3 mode supported.
. Useless messages removed.
. *Some* bugs that cause crashes fixed.
. *Some* modified gfx and sounds.

Note: The ranking screen works in Teamplay mode, but its kinda messed up.
Unlike version 1.0, this version has random skill setting disabled because
I found that advanced players prefered to play skill 3 bots most of the time
anyway and skill randomization just made it more tedious to spawn a skill 3.
Consider yourself warned :o)
