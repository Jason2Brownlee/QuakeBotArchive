 Forenote:
 ----------
    Another weapon in the Singe 'n Griphis summer of mayhem. }:> Like the
 Proton Storm, this weapon was also derived from Ranger X, a great old
 Genesis game.


 Description:
 -------------
    You have your own little robotic falcon helper. Send him off and watch
 him attack every enemy in sight.


 Helpful Instructions:
 ----------------------
  - You get the Seeker Falcon when you get your second Lightning Gun
  - Uses 10 cells (or all cells if you have less than 10) per launch,
     and uses one cell for each of its attacks. You get all cells it didn't
     use when it comes back. If it had to teleport back, you don't get the
     cells.
  - You can't switch weapons while the Seeker Falcon is out, but if you press
     the fire button, it will do its best to come back to you.


 Known Bugs:
 ------------
  - Some trigger ents make it fly sideways.


 Planned Stuff:
 ---------------
  - Better sounds. More sounds. We used too many stock Quake sounds.
  - I think there's even more.


 Versions:
 ----------
  1.1 - Doesn't stick in floors anymore. :)
        Smaller kbyte skin
