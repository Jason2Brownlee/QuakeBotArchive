ReaperBot with DeathMatch v4.0 Compatibility

Well, since u asked fer it, u got it :)

This is just yer plain 'ol Reaper, but has the new Deathmatch v4.0 Rules.

"How do I use it?" U ask, Well, it's simple, just start Yer Reapers the 
way u normally do, then type "deathmatch 4" at the console (Without quotes, of course)
restart the level, and Kick some Reaper ass.

"What's so different?" U wonder.... Well, Under the new Rules, all this:

-Start out with all weapons and Unlimited ammo!
-Start out with 250 Health and 200 Armor
-Temporarily Invulnerable when u respawn (2-4 secs)
-U get 10 health for each BackPack u pick up.
-When u reach 300 health, U get Invisibility, Invulnerability, 
 and Octa-Damage! (8x Damage) (Note: Upon Octa-Damage, all yer cells go 
 away, they return when it wears off)
-Weapons and Ammo don't respawn, But Armor and Health still does 
 (I'm not sure if that's right tho...Tell me if u find otherwise)
-Rocket Jumps Don't Hurt U! (I added that - not officially part of DMv4.0 Rules)

There's probably a couple things I'm missing, but u'll figure it out.
If u find any bugs, or have any suggestions on how to make it cooler,
I'd love to hear from ya!

ThanX fer all the requests!
