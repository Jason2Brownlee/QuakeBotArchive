ABOUT THIS BOT:
---------------

 This program is meant as an automatic player (a bot) for the game Quake,
 by id software. It will run with Quake version 1.0x.

 This program is also a fairly good deathmatch assistant: you play the normal 
 moves, and the bot handles some of the mundanities (like saying where the weapons
 are, and slaughtering any player that comes too close). 
 Of course, you'll have to be pretty bad, pretty low in morale or pretty
 lagged, before you use that kind of cheat.

STARTING THE BOT:
-----------------


 Command line examples:

 bot -h
 	Get some help.
 bot quake.best.com:22000
 	Connect to server quake.best.com port 22000
 bot 192.246.40.27 -auto 
 	Connect to idsoftware public server
 	Start playing in automatic mode (no proxy)
 bot quake.best.com  -game  aliens
 	Connect to server quake.best.com port 26000
 	Detect existing model/sound files in:
 	 id1/pak0.pak
         id1/pak1.pak
         aliens/*
        There will be a warning for each missing file.

---------------------
COMMANDS FOR THE BOT:
---------------------
        
 The bot console is a bit like the Quake console. 
 You write a command, then a space, then the eventual command parameters.
 Then you press RETURN and the command is executed. Fairly simple, indeed.

 The name of the commands sometime look like those in Quake, but actually
 only the first character is significant.
 
 Bot commands, before the bot begins playing:

 quit			= quit the bot
 info			= request game infos
 player			= request the list of players
 rule			= request the list of rules
 connect IPADDRESS:PORT	= connect to a server (IPADDRESS:PORT is optional)

 Bot Keyboard commands, while the bot is playing:

 quit			= disconnect and quit
 player			= list of players names, frags (and hate level)
 say     MESSAGE	= say MESSAGE to all the players
  
 Bot debug commands:
 
 a			= list of all players positions
 danger			= coordinates of all dangerous thingy
 x			= coordinates of all entities in the game
 entities		= infos on all entities in the game


----------------------
PLAYING IN PROXY MODE:
----------------------

 Proxy mode enables you to see through the eyes of the bot... or actually,
 to play a normal game, but with some automatic reflexes handled by the bot.


 Regular procedure:

 . Launch the bot on a machine situated on your local network.
   Send command 'i' (server infos) to check if the Quake server replies.
   If the server doesn't reply, you better restart your bot.

 . Launch a regular Quake Client, for Windows 95 (i.e. with TCP/IP enabled).
   Go to menu: MULTIPLAYER | JOIN GAME | TCP/IP
   Select SEARCH FOR LOCAL GAMES
   Normally, the bot will reply to this search, and in the list of
   servers, you should see one server called TERMINATOR: it's the bot, 
   waiting for you. So connect to TERMINATOR, and play as usual.

 Procedure for the UDP challenged:

   If the bot is on the same machine as the Quake client, or not on your local 
   network, of if it's running on some pervert O/S, the bot will be unable to 
   reply to SEARCH FOR LOCAL GAMES.
 
   If so, select JOIN GAME AT and enter the internet address of the bot (IP address).
   Normally, the bot should answer. 
   
   If it doesn't work, please check the IP address you used, and the port number
   of the bot (26000 by default, like Quake).
 
 
---------------------
BOT IMPULSE COMMANDS:
---------------------
 
  The bot catches some impulses, so that you can send simple command to it.
 
  keys 2 to 8  (impulses 2 to 8):
    If you press on a weapon you don't have, instead of saying "no weapon",
    the bot will orient your view toward the closest weapon of that kind, and 
    gives you the distance to this weapon, and the time since it was last seen.
  
  impulse 16:   
    This command toggles the bot automatic movements (disable/enable).
    Since the bot doesn't see the level yet, some of his moves are real stupid,
    and you'd better bind this impulse to an easily reached key, like P (pause).
  
  impulse 100:
    The bot will orient your view toward the closest player he knowns of, and
    give you the distance and the time since he was last seen.
  
  impulse 101 to 116:
    Same as impulse 100, but for a specific players (1 to 16). 
        
---------------
BOT POLITENESS:
---------------

 Some people rightfully consider that playing with bots is cheating.

 So if you don't like the idea of playing against this bot:

  - Type the message "No bots please"
    and the bot will immediatly disconnect.

  - Type the message "I love bots"
    and the bot will stop hating you (i.e. it will stop firing on you 
    and will not avoid your line of sight anymore).

 If you manage a server, and don't want bots on this server, please have 
 your server print the sentence "No bots please" when a client connects.    


------------------------
THE BEHAVIOR OF THE BOT:
------------------------
 
 Technical Note:
 
  - the proxy bot can only handle ONE QUAKE CLIENT.
  - it will usually connect ONCE to a server. Kill him after that.
  - under Win95, you might experience a 2 MINUTE DELAY when the quake 
    client connects to the proxy bot. This is a bug in the windows TCP/IP
    stack. The only solution is to reinstall your network from scratch
    (well that's what I did, and now it works fine).
    This is not a bug in the bot. It doesn't happen with the SUN version.
  - currently, no file is read. The bot is wall-blind
  - a bot doesn't see every entity in the level. If a player is out of sight,
    the bot cannot know where he is... until he makes a noise (even a faint one).

 Bot behavior currently implemented:
 
  - The bot will not attack you unless you attack him... well, sort of.
  - The bot locks on hated players, and fire on them.
  - The Bot knowns nothing about team play. Not implemented yet.
    your team mates will be exterminated like the others rats
    ("Only paranoids survive" -- remember you're playing on an Intel)
  - If the bot is hurt by a gunshot (or a shaft?) he will know who
    hit him, and will hate the guy with the utermost endeavor.
  - If the bot is hurt by a nail, rocket, or a grenade, there is no 
    reliable way to know who hit him, so the bot will hate the closest 
    player. So don't stay close to the bot
    If no one ic close, the bot will hate EVERYONE.
  - The bot avoids missiles, grenades, and the line of fire of
    hated people. The line of fire avoidance course usually force
    him to spiral around you, until he's close to you, and in 
    your back. 
  - If the bot cannot move in the direction it wants, he makes
    a random move (pretty stupid, I know... wait for the BSP code).
  - If you make a sound, the bot will know precisely where you are.
    But he won't move toward you :-)
  - If you drop a backpack, the bot will move toward it. That's
    currently his only reliable way to collect weapons.
    
  Known bugs and misfeatures:
  
  - If you do not run the bot from the Quake directory, then it CANNOT see
    the walls. In that case, it will often kill himself with the rocket
    launcher.
  - When the level can be loaded, the bot is supposed to see the walls. Well,
    sort of. Actually, it doesn't really use that information yet, because the
    AI is really deficient. It won't avoid lava pits, for instance.
  - Normally, the bot should not fire rockets at close range. But it happens
    very often. There must be a bug somewhere in the weapon switching code.
  - The bot will show the forecast position of the player with a cloud 
    of red dots. That's the point where you should fire, if you had a 
    rocket launcher. Unfortunately, the bot will refuse to let you use one.
    So this feature is here only to increase your frustration... for the moment.
  - The bot sees you before he should (because the server sends him
    updates even when he has no direct line of sight)
  - The bot is stupidly static, when no players are around.
    (well, actually, it makes some random moves)
  - The bot ignores the static entities (like <weapons, armors,
    and stuff) to avoid wasting too much time.
       

-----------
CONCLUSION:
-----------
 
  This is still a very early beta of the bot. Any decent player should be able
  to kick his ass pretty easily, since it doesn't look for weapons or health.
  
  It's more sophisticated than other client bots I could take a look at, but 
  it's certainly less sophisticated than the best Quake-C bots.
 
  I hope you'll enjoy this,
