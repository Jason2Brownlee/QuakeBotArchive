RELEASE NOTE:
I don't know if now Wyrm is "the most kickass collection" or "the last mod you
will ever need". The only I can promise to you is that I've worked really hard
into this version, and I hope that you'll enjoy playing it. This is the LAST 
version of Wyrm (well... if it has some important bug, I'll make a small
upgrade ;) so I tried to make it as good as possible. Maybe you're thinking
what I'll do after Wyrm... well... maybe learn some C for Quake 2 ;). Maybe
someday you'll hear about Wyrm 2 beta 1 ...

º  Description of the Modification  º
ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼
This is my first patch in Quake C. Making it I have learned a lot of this
powerful language (thanx John Carmack!!).
This is a Quake recompilation patch. Nearly all code has been modified by me,
in order to join and enhance them, and I think that the result isn't bad :).

º  How to Install the Modification  º
ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼
Who doesn't know this??
Simply go to Quake dir, make a subdirectory called "wyrm", copy the stuff into
it, and run quake with the ".bat" files included.
"wyrm.bat" if you use normal quake
"glwyrm.bat" for gl-quake

To run it without these files use:
	quake -game wyrm -hipnotic

You can add "-winmem 16" or "-heapsize 16000" if you have Win 95, but it works
fine with 8, I hope.

ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼
I've included the text files from the varies patches that I've combined,
and compressed them into TEXT.ZIP, so you could look at them and see
what the commands are, as well as the authors' email addresses.

Weapons recollection:
--------------------
-Super shotgun: if you get it and you don't have mossberg, you get it.
else, if you don't have the double-barrelled shotgun, you get it.
If you have the other two, you get the assault shotgun. Also, if you have
those all, you get the buster shot.
-Nailgun:First you will get the MP5, after the M16, and, at last, the Pulse
Rifle.
-Super nailgun: first the airgun, after the flamethrower, after the
freezethrower, and after a gravity well.
-Grenade launcher: first the grenade launcher, then the Devastator, and then
a Railgun :).
-Rocket launcher: first you will get regular missiles, after guided, after
homing, and finally, rocket pods.
-Lightning gun: first the plasma gun, after the Positron Beam, and after
the Proton Storm.

Impulse 1 weapons:
-----------------
* K-bar knife: a Navy Seal weapon :). it doesn't do so much damage, but it's
very fast and have a probability to chop enemies.
*Disc: Can chop enemies... it's fun to use.
*Hand grenade: another weapon from Navy Seal patch. The explosion is one of
the coolest things i see in Quake. It's useful if you don't have weapons that
use rockets.

Impulse 2 weapons:
-----------------
Note: all three weapons are from Navy Seal patch.I modified them a little, so
they have automatic reload, aiming and cool particles when fired to a wall :)

*Colt M16 Assault Rifle: Good at long and short distance. Have a 30 bullets
clip.
*MP5 Sub Machine Gun: it fires more fast, but do less damage per bullet. It
also have a 50 bullets clip.
*Mk23 Handgun: Very good at short range, but bad at a long one. It has a
12 bullets clip.

Impulse 3 weapons:
-----------------
*Assault Shotgun: ANOTHER weapon from Navy Seal. It's like an automatic
shotgun, and consumes shells very fast.
*Double-barrelled Shotgun:Cool model from Deft. It has a long reload time,but
do a LOT of damage at once!! :)
*Mossberg 590 tactical shotgun: Oh! another from Navy Seal!. It's good to
save ammo, and for medium ranges.

Impulse 4 weapons:
-----------------
*Pulse Rifle.-Fun and powerful :)
*Buster shot.-Shoots fast, is cheap, and removes other's armor.
*Devastator.-Deals tons of damage.

Impulse 5 weapons:
-----------------
*Airfist: Is one of the coolest weapons ever made. It doesn't need comments :)
*Flamethrower: the code is from Quake Command, but with a cool 3d model as a
flame, and a more cool weapon model from PAIN. When it burns someone, the fire
is like Blaze Gun.
*Freezethrower: It's the one from Ice Ion patch, but nearly all rewritten!!
Now , ice bounce at walls, and it can... freeze the water!!!

Impulse 6 weapons:
-----------------
*Normal Grenades: well... they are... normal.... :)
*Bouncer Grenades: they throw spikes when explode
*Cluster Grenades: when it explode, it throws a lot of normal grenades.
*Poison Grenades: it makes a cloud of poison gas that will poison your
enemies.

Impulse 7 weapons:
-----------------
*Normal Missiles: ...
*Guided Missiles: they cost 2 rockets, and you can seek and hunt your enemy
with it.:)
*Homing Missiles: as above, but the missile will make it for you.

Impulse 8 weapons:
-----------------
*Plasma gun: its the most "DooM" plasma I've seen for Quake...
*Positron Beam:It cost 20 cells, but it has a bunch of damage. It can kill a
Shambler with one shot.
*Proton Storm: Cost 30 cells, and it ANIHILATES all... I had to put a fix in
order to stop it killing Shub with one shot ;)))

Impulse 225 weapons:
--------------------
*Railgun: Can go thought walls and enemies :) inflicts tons of damage
*Rocket pods: Each pod is like a missile... :P
*Gravity well: This is a lot of fun with a lot of players in a room ;)

Impulse 226 weapons:
--------------------
*Harpoon: It's the best harpoon I could find :)
*Mjolnir: Directly from Scourge of Armagedon
*Chainsaw: Well... it inflicts tons of damage and chop your enemies into
little pieces... what more can you ask for??

Teamplay and Deathmatch:
-----------------------
See Wyrm.cfg for details :)

Monster enhancements:
--------------------
I don't want Wyrm to be an only deathmatch compilation. I want also to enhance
single player game experience. To do this, I added some stuff...
-Grunts have different weapons (double-barrelled grunt can kill you with one
shot!)
-New type of fiend: the hell fiend (comes from your nightmares to KILL YOU)
-Ogres fire missiles if they are far enough from you. Also, they've gained an
armor.
-Enemies respawn in nightmare!! (now it will be really a NIGHTMARE! he he)
-Ogre, knights and hell knights can chop you  :)
-Added cranked. See cranked.txt for more details.
-Scrags fire a lot more :). Also added 2 new types: Hell scrag and Chthon
scrag.
-New type of enforcer! Rail enforcer :)

Map information:
---------------
Since I think that there won't be any really "Wyrm map", I've removed the rain
and some other things to add more weapons.
