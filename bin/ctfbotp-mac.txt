============================================================



NOTE: This is an unsupported release,if you have any

problems or question's please email me at

pbuddha@infonet.isl.net



I am NOT accountable for loss of life or limb or drives...

use at your OWN RISK!



IMPORTANT! you must follow these steps or CTFBot+ will not

work with MacQuake!



The Lowdown: CTFBot+ is a cool client-side bot for playing

Threewave Capture the Flag.



Don't know what Capture the Flag is? check it out......

http://www.captured.com/threewave/



The CTFBot+ homepage can be found at

http://www.captured.com/ctfbot/



I'm assuming you know a little about quake and know how to

play CTF (more info,www.captured.com),also READ THE DOCS! I

can't stress that enough, the CTFBot+ docs are located in

the "docs" folder check them out so you know what its all

about.



============================================================

Requirements to play CTFBot+ in MacQuake:



You must get the threewave client side patches

(http://www.captured.com/threewave/files.html)

you need 3.0 and 4.0,but there is an archive with both..

download it!

============================================================



============================================================

Playing CTFBot+:



Put this folder (ctfbotp) in your quake folder.  Make sure

pak0.pak and pak1.pak from the Threewave .zip you downloaded

are in the ctfbot folder, you MUST have the 2 pak's to play.

You then will have pak0.pak pak1.pak and pak2.pak in your

ctfbot folder.



Now drag and drop the whole folder onto your quake

application(note:3dfx is untested..) Quake should

boot now.  It should have the CTF flags as the backround

splash screen, if it doesnt, it did not load the CTF .pak

files.



Once your in quake it will drop you into CTF1.  To play

with the bots you MUST initiate a multi-player game.  Also

you MUST check the multiplayer option's and make sure your

max players is set to 15. Choose your frag and timelimit

(note CTF games have higher frag limits due to the scoring)

then click on START to start a multiplayer game. It doesnt

matter what level you start on, as you'll be changing maps

from the console (hit the ~ key).

(Note: when you start the game up you CAN play right away ,

but if you do not start a multi-player game, you will not be able

 to see the bots on the scoreboard.)



Bring down the console and type in "map ctf1" or any of the

other supported ctf maps, the included .dat file has

waypoints for :



ctf1

ctf2

ctf3

ctf4

ctf5

ctf6

ctf7

ctf8

ctf2m1

ctf2m2

On other maps you won't be able to order the bots around.

If anyone wants the id maps or any of the Thunderwalker maps

with waypoints, let me know for the next release (note the

TW wepons and runes are NOT supported, just the maps....they

go, with any other 3rd party maps in the "maps" folder)





Currently several keys are bound by default:



F5	will spawn a friendly bot

F6	will spawn an enemy bot

F7 will remove red bot

F8 will remove blue bot



q	bot attack

w	bot defend

e	bot escort

r toss wepon

t toss ammo

y will toss flag

u toss rune





Please read the ctfbot+.txt file for information on changing

the DEATHMATCH variable.  By default "Weapons stay" is on.



Please read the ctfbot14.txt file for information on

changing the TEAMPLAY variable.  By default it's set to 4067 which enables

health protect

armor protect

static teams

drop items

custom capture

team select

impulse freedom



These variables can be changed by modifying the autoexec.cfg file in the

ctfbotp folder.

please see documentation for info on how to tweak these to your liking.



Bot skill is 1 by default, type "skill0", "skill1", "skill2"

or "skill3"  before spawning bots to change (see the docs

for more bot info)



Note for 3dfx users: as I have no mac 3d card this is untested, but if the

bots

all spawn orange or some other color,try typing "TEMP1 8" at the console before

spawning the bots. If it works please e-mail me and let me know! I hope to

test 3dfx

quake and rave quake soon.



The docs tell you what impulses you can bind for other

options...read them!!  To play on a LAN all players must

have the same ctfbot folder.  LAN play on a mac is untested,

so no whining if it crashes. (if you want more mac testing,

send me another power mac:)
