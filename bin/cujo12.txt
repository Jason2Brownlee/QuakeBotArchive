บ  Description of the Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

This mod creates a personal attack dog which will follow the
player and attack his enemies, even drawing fire in the process.

The dog will not attack zombies, since it cannot gib them.

This bot is based on original dog code and some code from
DM Bot 1.0.  The dog does not have any manual control functions
like those bots do.  He's all auto or he's dead.

บ  How to use Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

Impulse 100  Activates and Deactivates the dog

Impulse 102  Tell Cujo to stay or follow.  When staying, Cujo will stand
             where he is until he sights an enemy or he is told to follow.
             If Cujo sights an enemy, he will automatically leave stay mode
             and return to the player after killing all targets (if he can).
             Thanks to NAME HERE for suggesting this!

Impulse 103  This toggles your screen between the player and Cujo's points
             of view.  It's not working correctly yet!

Impulse 104  Teleport the dog to your location.

Impulse 105  Turns on Cujo's collar lamp.  Great for dark places.

Impulse 106  Reports on Cujo's status.  If Cujo is not visible to the player
             then his status cannot be determined.

Impulse 107  Toggles Cujo between attack and non-attack modes.

Bind these impulses to keys to make commanding Cujo easy.  For example, to
make the Q key activate and deactivate Cujo put this line in your
config.cfg file (or type it in the Quake console):

BIND Q "IMPULSE 100"

Now, every time you press Q Cujo will be toggled between his active and
inactive state.  You can bind the other two impulses in a similar manner.

บ  How to Install the Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ


Unzip CUJO12.ZIP into a temporary directory and run INSTALL.BAT
with the full path of your Quake directory.  For example, if Quake
is located in C:\GAMES\QUAKE then you would type:

INSTALL C:\GAMES\QUAKE

This will install the necessary files in a directory called CUJO
which is inside of your Quake directory, and also create a batch
file in the Quake directory called CUJO12.BAT which will run the
modified version of Quake.

If you are interested in seeing how this was done, you can manually
unzip the file SOURCE.ZIP which was contained inside CUJO12.ZIP
and look at the modified source.  If you would like to make your
own Quake C mods, get QCC.ZIP and read the instructions contained
within it.  Also, find one of the many web pages with info about
Quake modifications to learn more.

บ  Technical Details  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออผ

Features:

 Cujo can draw enemy fire, lessening the amount of damage the player takes.

 Seeks out monsters or other players and attacks them.

 Will continue to attack as long as an enemy target is visible.

 Will not attack teammates under Teamplay rules.

 Cujo can follow the player through portals.

 Cujo will not activate trigger fields (such as light triggers and traps)

 Cujo is trained *not* to attack zombies, allowing you to toss a grenade
  in there without blowing up your dog in the process.  (But he will
  sometimes lick their gibs when your done - hey, dogs will be dogs!)

 Cujo is a special, genetically enhanced breed of Rottweiler with 8 times
  the endurance of other dogs his size.  He can cause up to twice as much
  damage per attack as his piddly cousins, too.  And to top it all off,
  Cujo is wearing a special suit of armor designed specifically with him
  in mind.  Cujo is one *bad* dog.

 Cujo cannot be injured by your shotgun blasts, axe, or thunderbolts, but
  you can hurt him with nailguns and rockets, so keep this in mind when
  firing at an enemy your faithful companion is already tearing to pieces.

 Cujo is equipped with a special device based on slipgate technology.
  Should he become separated from you, you can teleport him to your own
  location instantly.  Cujo is even smart enough to activate this device
  on his own when the distance becomes very great.

 Cujo does not need to be fed.  He takes care of this himself.

 Cujo just loves to tackle big Shamblers while you put the nails to 'em!

 This is not Sea Quest, so no amount of technology will allow you to talk
  to an animal.  He jsut growls and barks like animals do.


Bugs:

 Cujo does not jump or walk past edges unless he is attacking, at which
  point he can fall into water and become lost.

 Cujo will sometimes become preoccupied with a gib that he cannot reach,
  even though he can see it.  To fix this right now, tell Cujo not to
  attack.  This is basically an AI problem related to the fact that Cujo
  has trouble with jumping from ledges.

 Cujo sometimes gets lost.  Okay.  Maybe it happens pretty often.

 Please email about any other bugs!

บ  Future Enhancements  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออผ

 He still needs ai enhancments, but I haven't even begun to work on this
  yet.  I had enough freaking trouble getting him to pick up the gibs.  It
  seems that Quake doesn't *always* register a touch between two objects
  when it should, so I had to hack it, but from the players point of view
  there's no difference.  Anyway, figuring out a way to counteract this
  apparent quirk took up most of the time for this version.

 Hopefully I can do some model work next time around and give Cujo a few
  more movements, like sitting and bending down to eat gibs.  This will
  probably be more annoying than I'm willing to put up with though...

 I'd like to give Cujo his own powerup, but this would require either
  replacing another powerup completely and not guaranteeing Cujo can be
  used on every level, or creating new maps for Cujo deathmatches.  For now
  you'll just have to get Cujo by picking up the yellow armor.

บ  Revision History  บ
ศออออออออออออออออออออผ

Changes in version 1.2

 Cujo will eat gibs and heads for health.  Eating either will heal him 15
  points.  If there are no enemies around and Cujo's health is 90% or less
  he will eat any gibs he sees.  If Cujo's health is 25% or less he will
  go after any visible gibs even if enemies are visible to him.  Cujo will
  not go after gibs if he has been told not to attack.  Thanks to Gary 
  Mcmillin" <psyhe@hitech.net.au> for this idea!

 New rules for Cujo in a deathmatch:
  1) You must pick up a yellow armor to get Cujo.  You will still get the
     yellow armor, but Cujo will be made available to you for ONE USE.  If
     you don't need the armor because yours is better or the same IT STILL
     GETS PICKED UP.  This is to prevent the Cujo powerup from staying around
     for other people to pick up.  If your armor is better, you will still
     keep the better armor, but the armor powerup will disappear.
  2) You can only spawn one Cujo at a time.
  3) You can only keep one Cujo powerup at a time.  You CAN spawn a Cujo
     and then pick up another Cujo powerup, but if you pick up a second
     powerup, you will still only have one other use.  There is no counter
     for how many Cujo powerups you can have.  You either have one or you
     don't!
  4) Instead of 200 health and 200 red armor, Cujo gets 100 health and
     150 yellow armor in deathmatch.

 Cujo has a a refined skin, thanks to Ed Oviedo <joviedo@gibson.com>, who
  smoothed it out with Photoshop.  Thanks, Ed.

 Cujo no longer teleports away when he is killed.  Either he get's gibbed,
  or his body remains where it falls.  Much cooler.  The bodies stay around
  for a few minutes.  Don't ask me to make all bodies solid.  I tried this
  and it sucks.  They just get in the way.

 You can find out Cujo's health and armor status as long as he is in view
  of the player.

 You can tell Cujo to stay or follow.  If Cujo is staying he will still
  attack enemies, but he will not follow the player.  Thanks to Betty Hardy
  <bhardy@idcnet.com> for giving me the idea.

Changes in version 1.1

 Cujo now *looks* like a Saint Bernard!  Okay, he looks like a white
  rottweiler with brown spots.  The dog skin doesn't seem to map quite
  as regularly as the player skin (the dog skin is drawn at a weird angle)
  so a 3 of the triangles that make up the dog were mapping wierdly and
  I couldn't seem to change them completely.  Also, St. Bernards have
  floppy ears and long tails, but Cujo doesn't, cause he's still made
  from a rottweiler model.  If you think the new skin sucks, let me know,
  because I'm not completely satisfied with it.  Your feedback will be
  appreciated.

 fixed the absence of \n's (returns) after some of Cujo's barks and
  growls

 Cujo now spawns to the right of the player if possible and will not
  activate at all if there is no room around the player

 Cujo can now be told to break off an attack, or not to attack at all.
  This makes it a lot easier to avoid killing him when you want to
  punch a rocket into what he's attacking.

 Messages concerning Cujo's activation, deactivation and death now
  all appear in the center of the screen, while Cujo's comments appear
  at the top left. (Cujo also whines when he want's to attack and you
  won't let him...)

Changes in version 1.0

 What changes?  This was the first one.
