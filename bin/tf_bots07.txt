2) Make sure you have Team Fortress 2.8 which can be found here:

	http://www.thegamebox.net/files/Planet_Quake/teamfortress/tf28inst.exe

	or here:

	http://www.fileplanet.com/index.asp?section=618&file=27370


3) Unzip my TFBots07 into your TF directory
4) Start a game with a command line like this:

	C:\Quake\TQ146.exe -game fortress +deathmatch 1 -listen 16

5) To start a game type 'map begin' in the console 

 

 
IMPORTANT NOTE:


Make sure your pak files are numbered sequentially. 
Some things are different in this Team Fortress. That is, some rules and
entities have been slightly altered to deliver a solid single player experience.
I have not does this because I wanted to; simply put, this is the version of TF that
I am capable of coding, and the version of TF that the bots are capable of playing.

If you are skeptical or cynical about this, you won't have any fun. But if you keep
an open mind and you enjoy QuakeC bot mods, you will have a good time.
Perhaps a very good time. Indeed, I think this is my finest work. These bots will
capture flags, kill presidents, and in general kick yo skinny white ass.

 
GAMEPLAY MODES:


Deathmatch 1:	Cature the Flag: snatch the enemy flag and bring it back to yours.
		Capture points have been removed for now.

Deathmatch 3:	Assassination: each team has a president in their fort. Kill the
		enemy chief executive to score. He will respawn in 30 seconds.

Deathmatch 4:	One-Flag Domination: a flag is spawned in the middle of the map.
		Touch it to take control and earn points.

Deathmatch 5:	Occupation: one team is chosen to defend their base, while the
		other must attack it. Penetrate to the core of the base, and stay there
		as long as possible. The attackers get points for each teammate that
		occupies the defender base core.

Deathmatch 6:	Sabotage: each team has a generator in their base. Destroy it to
		score. The fastest way is to detpack it.

Deathmatch 7:	FortBall: like football, a ball will spawn in the middle of the map. grab
		it and run it deep into the enemy fort to earn a touchdown

Canal Zone 2K:	There are four command points throughout the map. Take control
		of these to score points.

The Rock:		Flip the switch in the enemy fortress to execute their team.

 
TIPS:

* try all bot skill settings
* bind important commands to keys!
* turn on the status bar with "sbar_on"
* for the sniper, turn on autozoom with "autozoom"
* some of the maps astounded me. even if you are a longtime TF fan, you
should check out as many as you can
* mix and match gameplay modes and maps. you'll get interesting situations

 
COMMANDS:

These can be typed into the console but I recommend binding
them, for example bind n "nextbot"

addbot: bring up bot menu
botteam: change their team
botskill: change their skill
botspeed: adjust bot speed
nextbot: create a random bot (teams will be evened)
attack: order a bot to attack enemy base
defend: order a bot to defend your fort
escort: tell a bot to escort you
report: see what bots are doing
heal: ask a medic to heal you
