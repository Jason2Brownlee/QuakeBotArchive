Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

Currently, this is the most sophisticated Quake C Bot available.

The Eliminator Bot package provides you with some decent adversaries
to play Quake against. Don't have a network connection? Maybe you
have a $100,000 LAN at home but no friends... Well, here is the
answer to your Deathmatch dreams. These automated deathmatch opponents
are by no means friendly and they'd just love to kick your sorry
behind all over the place. What's more, they aren't stupid like
most of the other bots out there. These know how to fight and know
their way around.

Features Include:

* Sophisticated AI Engine
* True deathmatching on a whole level - just like human players
* Up to 10 bots on a level
* Bots know how to use all the of weapons
* Ability to give the bots knowledge of any level
* Server capability - deathmatch bots vs humans!
No other files needed by the clients.
* Observer Mode - watch the bots battle it out!
* Auto startup - define how many you want to start when you run Quake
* Skins - give the bots their own identities!

Updates 1.1 -> 1.2

* Now uses "skins". If you have the player.mdl from the skins
patch you can DM Duke Nukem and his friends (well... he ain't got
any, I know :)
