I modified the tmbot qc mod to shoot grenades at zombies.
I cannot take much credit for this mod because i am not really a good 
proggrammer and the bot is mostly Micheal Polucha's (mpolucha@earthlink.net)
code.
Much credit to him!

Check tmbot.txt for more important info!


bugs
1. the lazer still fires at zombies
2. grenade sound still plays for lazers

As i said i am not a real programmer so can someone please tell me when the fix it?
