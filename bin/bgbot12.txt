Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
Basicly a TM and DM bot slightly modded. This bot
can pick up Health, Armor, Weapons, and Ammo. Also
chooses which weapons is better of the weapons it
has picked up. Also shoots all players and other
bots. You can create as many bots as you like, memory
allowing.

Impulse 100 creates a bot. There is no way to
get rid of the bots unless you kill it. They also
have control of themselves.

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
Make a new dir in your quake directory. (ie c:\quake\pun)
then move this progs.dat into that directory and copy your
*.cfg from c:\quake\id1 into the same directory. Then run quake
ala
quake -game bg

then bind a key to impulse 100

Technical Details
-----------------
Any bugs lemme know please?

STILL NEEDS:
Better roaming AI.
(still walks same patterns)(Anyone willing to help?)
Ability to walk into water, swim, jump, and walk over cracks
in floor.
Trying to get the bots score to come up on changelevel or when
player dies. Cant seem to figure it out.(ie brain
fried.)
If anyone can lend some insight, lemme know.
In Teamplay, Coop, and one player he is pretty useless on any
level that has cracked floor, stairs, water, etc.

VERSION 1.2:
