BASE:

Building Time
=============

Used Tools
==========
Notepad
FrogBot Editor 1.8


Description
===========
A Quake-Mod that combines the Frogbot and Teamplay-Abilities. 
Especially emulation of SQC (Syndicate Quake Clan) and 
PENT (Das Pentagon). So u can fight with 3 bot-teammates 
against the other clan.


Installation
============
Unzip into your Quake folder. default directory is frogSvsP
if you make another change it in qwsv.bat!
Copy the skins into your qw/skins-directory.


Running the game
================
Normal Quake:
1.) run qwsv.bat from the driectory, you extrected the files in.
2.) run priority.exe (Win9x only)
3.) run your qw-client, proxy is no problem
4.) connect to your server by typing "connect localhost" or 
    ".c localhost", if playing with proxy.
5.) press n ... or exec emu.cfg manualy

6.) do a mapchange to take effect all setting-changes 
    (f.e.: type "rcon map dm6")
7.) either run hole clans by typing "sqc" or "pent" 
     (or deathrow or nine)
    or call your sqc- or pent-helpforce (3 bots) 
     with "sqch" or "penth" 
    You are even able to spawn single bots! see below!
or
6.&7.) follow menu (look in console)

8.) type "ready", wait 15 seconds and fight!


Important Notes
===============
- You should have wordwrap enabled in your text editor to view this file.
- Refer to readme012c.txt for more information on the Frogbot.
- don't forget to turn off deadbodyfilter, if playing with proxy.
- i prefer to switch off teamcolor, enemycolor an enemyskin, 
  too, but it's your free desission
- after running emu.cfg, be sure to do a mapchange to take 
  effect all changes..  sorry, but right now, i don't know how 
  to change the settings serverside.
- look into console to see menu!
- TeamColor, EnemyColor, EnemySkin and DeadBodyFilter is set off 
  by nfproxy_frogsvsp.cfg


Features & Commands
===================
- sqc command spawns 4 sqc-bots: [SQC]GuRu, [SQC]LaFFiniuM, 
  [SQC]mADmAn, [SQC]Locuti

- sqch command spawns 3 sqc-bots: [SQC]GuRu, [SQC]mADmAn, 
  [SQC]Locuti so you can play 4on4, if you play SQC!

- pent command spawns 4 pent-bots: [PENT]JimBeam, [PENT]DJ, 
  [PENT]Eagle, [PENT]Pitti

- penth command spawns 3 pent-bots: [PENT]JimBeam, [PENT]DJ, 
  [PENT]Eagle so you can play 4on4, if you play PENT!

- commands to spawn singlebots:
  sqcguru 	[SQC]GuRu
  sqcmadm 	[SQC]mADmAn
  sqclaff	[SQC]LaFFiniuM
  sqclocut	[SQC]Locuti
  pentdj	[PENT]DJ
  pentjim	[PENT]JimBeam
  pentsav	[PENT]Saviour
  pentpit	[PENT]Pitti
  penteag	[PENT]Eagle
  This bots have all diffrent skills!
  shortcuts for deathrows & nine are also ok... 
  check out the teams.cfg

- emu command starts all settings for ClanMatch... 
  it is default binded to "n"

- throw_gun command tosses your weapon if its better 
  than a shotgun, bots will go after these weapons as 
  long as they aren't in lava etc. Good for helping 
  teammates.

- Teamtalk and greetings : adds a little atmosphere.

- Dropquad : serverinfo dq 1 in qw to enable, in NQ 
  command its just dropquad. 

- team names : localinfo team4 xxxx and 
  localinfo team12 yyyy allow team names for bots 
  added with addbot4 and addbot12. this is a qw only 
  feature and it works only with color 4 and 12 with 
  my cfgs! If you want to use other colors change 
  xxxplay.cfg!

- pingtypes : in qw localinfo pingtype lan/isdn/modem, 
  default is isdn, this is enirely cosmetic.

- QW rockets are fixed, also in NQ they are emulated 
  in qwphysics mode. This allows some nice RJ's to be 
  done that were previously impossible.

- QWAIM in NQ is improved, a bit closer to real qw 
  aiming, still got some ideas left to implement so 
  expect more  in next version.

- Modified impulses : impulse 8 selects best 
  non-explosive gun, impulse 7 selcts RL or best weapon 
  below, impulse 6 is GL or best lower, impulse 12 is 
  like impulse 8 but selects SNG if you are underwater.

- In pre-match time bots only use axes :)))
