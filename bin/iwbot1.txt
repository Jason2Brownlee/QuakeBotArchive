Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

        Well, this is my deathmatch bot I have been working on. Using the
        original TMBOT as the base, I began work. Within a few days their
        was most of the original TMBOT code had been revamped,changed or
        taken out. Then BGBOT was released. I found it had
        success with a few things I wanted to do, but was having trouble with
        or was too busy with other things to implement. So I put in stuff from
        BGBOT. Now Its beginning to shape up. There are alot of stuff I want
        to do with it, but it works and want to release a version.

        This will create a deathmatch opponent. This opponent will be able to
        use all weapons except Lightning gun. He will pick up objects including
        powerups. He dodges and hunts his killer after respawning.
        It is very deadly. NOTE: THERE IS STILL BUGS!
        
How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

To install, unzip the IWBOT.zip. Make a directory in your Quake directory
called IWBOT. Copy the progs.dat from the zip into the IWBOT directory.
Now make a directory in IWBOT directory called PROGS. Copy null.spr from
the zip into the PROGS directory.
From your main Quake directory, type:
        quake -game iwbot
and hit enter. Once the game loads, press escape for the menu, and select
multiplayer game. From the multiplayer menu, select start new game.
From this menu select Direct Connect. Now is a listing of settings for the game.
Choose your starting episode and hit start game.
This will begin the deathmatch.




Technical Details
-----------------

Well, since this is version 0.1 you can expect there to be updates.
This version is still really rusty.
I am having trouble with the following things:

Getting the bot to search for items without trying to walk through walls
Getting the bot to walk off ledges
Getting the bot to pick up health
Getting the bot to face the opponent better
Getting the bot to think through another entity(see source code for beginning of my work) 
Getting the bot to activate all buttons and triggers
getting the bot to sidestrafe and continually change its facing and thus
        the direction of the sidestrafe(for circle strafes)
getting the bot not to flip out when dodging nails.
Name of bots and frag counts on score lists

Things I want to do, but haven't tried:

Add Lightning Gun to bot's weaponry
Add Axe to bot's weaponry
get bot to jump intelligently
get the bot to avoid lightning better(gets nailed by lightning every time!)
get bot to learn(perform better based on number of frags)
get bot to have skill rankings (Have the bot not appear on Start.bsp, but
        all others. This way you can select a skill level for your bot to
        play against.)
ability to add bots to the fray(one spawns when you initially spawn,
        and it keeps respawning)
Random quotes for the bot
Random names for the bot
New skin for the bot
Bot teamplay(maybe have a 2 players compete against 2 bots, or 1 player
        and a bot versus another player and a bot.)
More careful about up close firing of rocket launcher and grenade launcher
Aiming in front of opponent to lead them.

(wow, quite a list)

Author Information
------------------

I have programmed a little over the years, and plan on getting a degree
in programming over the next couple of years. This is my first real mod.
I released a patch called IRONWULV.zip, it was an early mod of my single
player mod I am still working on.
