Hopefully this will shut you up, I included the decompiled code. It is
complete, and nearly accurate to the original, however the decompiler can't
differenciate global constants, so those are often misnamed. It took about
twice as long to do with PQCC than it did with ACCQC, but I figured you
wanted "C" like code, not QuakePascal. Still, it was only about 4 minutes
of work on my part. No code is missing, nothing is commented out. And if
you use this for purposes other than personal education without Steven
Polge's permission, well, bad things will happen.
