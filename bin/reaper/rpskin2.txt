Type of Mod
-----------
Quake C  : no
Sound    : no
MDL      : yes

Build Time: (ripoff time is more appropriate!) 4 hours

Desription:

Switched some skins, dropped some that didn't look too good in the
game, and added Enforcer and the Quake Ogre in armor with matching 
head skin.  One of the BGbot skins is now skin15 for team bot play. 
(STEVE IF YOU HAVE VISION OF WHAT THE REAPERBOT SHOULD LOOK LIKE LET
ME KNOW).  Put standard Quake guy back in for skin 1 (default, and for 
benefit of clients who do not have the skin file, so they appear normal 
to those who do, oops). So if you're by yourself, you may like rpskin.zip
better.  All of the skins files and the tools I used (besides mspaint) 
were found at ftp.cdrom.com.  Of course the Terminator is still skill 3. 
If you don't like my combinations, get Quakeme23 and some .mdl files and 
make your own, its easy.

1 - Quake Guy 		(default botskin)
2 - BGbot1 skin  		(skill 0)
3 - Quake Soldier	  	(skill 1) 
4 - Quake Ogre in player armor	(skill 2) 
5 - Terminator     		(skill 3) 
6 - Predator
7 - Star Wars trooper
8 - Quake Enforcer
9 - Toad man
10- Quake biosuit
11- Duke Nukem
12- Skeleton man
13- Quake guy (Quad-Damage face)
14- Quake guy (Invincible face)
15- Quake guy (red eyes)
16- BGbot2 skin (Teamplay skin)

Installation:

Make a PROGS subdirectory in your RPBOT directory. Put .mdl files
in the PROGS subdirectory.  See Polge's text files also for info.
