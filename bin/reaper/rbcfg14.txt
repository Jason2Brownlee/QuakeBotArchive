Reaper Script v1.4 for the Reaper Bot v0.81 by NecroBoi     rbcfg14.zip
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  This script was designed for exclusive use with Steven Polge's
  Reaper Bot. An Episode/Map Menu had been provided to complement
  the Reaper Script giving direct access to the Deathmatch Arenas.
   
  ZIP contents: Reaper.rc, Readme.txt

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


- setup info

  Print out this Readme.txt. UnZIP RBCFG14.ZIP into the c:\quake\rpbot
  or the subdirectory where your Reaper Bot files reside.
            
  Assuming you copy the Reaper Bot progs.dat into the 'rpbot'
  directory, the commandline should look like:

           quake -zone 512 -game rpbot -listen 16 +skill 1

  Once in the game bring down the console and type "exec reaper.rc"
  minus the quotes. You can put this command at the end of your
  autoexec.cfg or config.cfg to run this script automatically.

  Featuring an actual learning and adaptive AI, this is definitely the
  best Quake deathmatch bot produced to date. If you have tried this
  bot, then you know there are quite a few impulses to configure and
  to remember. For my REAPER.RC I have also included the following
  aliases giving you some administrative functions to make setting up
  a bot game that much easier:

  - (F1) adds 1 bot and (F2) adds 4 bots. Refer to the original
    documentation for editing 'add 3 team bots', (F3).

    - When teamplay is set I would press (F2) for 4 opposing bots and
      (F3) to add 3 bots on my team.
 
  - A Skill Selector (k and l) - lower and higher respectively; to
    query current skill setting press (j); the Skill script contains
    fractional values allowing you to really find a suitable skill
    level to play with the bot

  - Fraglimit (n); Cycles up to 50 frags; you can edit this script to
    add more values if you wish

  - Timelimit (m); Cycles up to 60 mins; you can edit this script to
    add more values or change the time increments if you wish

  - Playmode Selectors have been added to allow you to set up specific
    game types without having to go to the menu or the console. (,)
    selects Single Player. (.) selects Deathmatch and toggles between
    mode 1 and 2. (/) selects Teamplay and cycles 4 modes of play.

    - After setting up your specified game with fraglimit, skill, etc.,
      use the restart key (HOME) to allow all updated settings to take
      effect. You can also use (END) to disconnect from your game.

    - If you are using Multiskin remember to toggle on Skins (p) after
      restarting a level; toggle twice if you prefer Skins Mode 2

    - The Single Player Selector (,) resets fraglimit, timelimit, and
      noexit OFF, and sets skill to 1 (normal)

  - Top 3 scores (TAB) replaces the default +showscores HUD. I have
    added the regular bot score table (BACKSPACE) which brings down
    the console for viewing.

  - Episode/Map Menu (END); press to disconnect from the current game
    and bring up the Menu in the console; the selections are (m0-m10);
    m0 is the Start map, m1-m4 are the first levels for the Episodes,
    and m5-m10 are the Deathmatch Arenas

    - You can edit the entries for the Episodes if you prefer to start
      at a specific map, other than the first levels. I suggest using
      the Secret Levels as alternative starts since these levels are
      normally bypassed if you run through the Episodes with fraglimit
      or timelimit set. The Secret Levels are:

      E1M8 - Ziggurat Vertigo
      E2M7 - Underearth
      E3M7 - The Haunted Halls
      E4M8 - The Nameless City

- Other Things

  For v1.4 I decided to omit MENU.RC and put the Episode/Map Menu in
  REAPER.RC since this file would not exceed the 7K file size limit
  that is imposed on RC files. If your configuration size is large
  when starting up Quake, it may still be a good idea to exec the
  REAPER.RC in the console, rather than initializing it from your
  own startup file.
    
  Many of the players I know use the ADSW location on the keyboard
  for movement controls so I have deliberately left that area of
  keyboard free in coordinating the layout for this script. It was
  also taken from Network Script v4.4 which also contains a script
  for playing on Threewave CTF servers. You can get <qcfg44n.zip>
  at ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/console/ or contact me for it.

  Mike Kelly (elkabong@oanet.com) has made a Reaper Bot Skins file
  <reaprskn.zip> which allows you to play against the bots with dif-
  ferent colored player skins creating the illusion of a real death-
  match. You can find this file and The Reaper Bot <reaprb81.zip> at
  ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/quakec/bots/reaper/.
