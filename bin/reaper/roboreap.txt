Build time: about 10-15 hours for the Skins

Sound    : no
MDL      : yes  


Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

This .MDL includes 5 skins for use with the Reaper Bot. One is the player 
character, obviously. The other four are based on a robot design I created.
When I first heard about the bots for quake, images of machines running 
around destroying everything in sight came to mind. I've tried to make the 
main design similar to that of a robot designed for war. 

Which Skins are which? 
----------------------

The Skins follow the Skin Specifications for the Reaper Bots. However, due
to myself only having 8mbs of RAM, I had to restrict myself, and thus could
not include as many robot designs as I wanted. If there is significant 
interest in this .MDL, then I'll design a full 16-skin version with several
more robot designs and variations.

Skill           Description
-------------------------------------------------------
No Skins        Player Skin
0 (Easy)        Soldier/Red Robot, glowing red eyes, edges of head and edges
		of armour.  Trousers, belt and logo change colour. Grey 
		boots

		Trousers belt and logo change colour. Grey boots

3 (Nitemare)    Commander/Black Robot. Almost completely pitch black, with

If you want more robots, I have a ton more ideas up my sleeve


How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

First, you'll need a copy of the Reaper patch. This can be obtained from :-

ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/quakec/bots/reaper/reapr08b.zip

Follow the installation instructions in that zip file for the reaper bot.

Next, you'll need to install the .mdl. Make a directory in you reaper bot
directory called progs. Move the .mdl in there. Simple as that!


Author Information
------------------

This is the first, and hopefully not the last skins I do. Hopefully in the 
future I'll also do some more skins and maybe some replacement skins. I was
gonna do a Marilyn Manson Quake, but it appears a project is already in 
the works. Oh well
