Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
Just a multiskin file for Reaperbot. It allows for 16 different Reaperbots
to run around, instead of the drab brown ones. Very interesting.

Got the idea from reaprskn.zip, which changed the bots into 16 different
colored players. I realized that there wasn't one made for ReaperBots that
allowed totally different skins, so I made it. I enjoy it. 

Now that this is version 2.0 with head gibs, I have to make an apology! I
didn't list the skins in the patch and who made them. Terribly sorry, Here they are:

  #1 QUAKE GUY - id Software

  #4 NYPD COP - Charlie Stevenson (Carlitos@sisna.com)
		Head Gibs by BUKE (mbuckton@Direct.Ca)

  #6 HAN SOLO - Dan Bickell (danbickell@loop.com)

  #7 DARK TOAD - David Silverman (DrkToad@aol.com)

  #9 HENRY ROLLINS - Scott Roberts (scaatt@execpc.com)

I have my first skin included in here, for your viewing pleasure. It's Sub-Zero.
I just wanted to do an easy one. What do you think?

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
In your ReaperBot directory, (where you have the ReaperBot's files stored)
make a directory called progs and place player.mdl and h_player.mdl in it.
Start the game normally with the ReaperBots, and before you add one, hit P to
enable skin mode. Then hit N for 4 bots, B for 1. You should know the procedure.

Technical Details
-----------------
Technical? I used QuakeMe 2.3.. that's about it.

Author Information
------------------
This is my first Quake Mod ever distributed. I am quite proud of it, since
I haven't done anything before. I have alot of free time on my hands to do
this stuff.. but I can't tell you my age, or people will scorn me. ;)
