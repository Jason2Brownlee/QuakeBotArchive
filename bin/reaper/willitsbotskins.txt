Willits Bot Skin Pack
=====================

This is a modified player.mdl and h_player.mdl for use with the
ReaperBots or any other bots that use MultiSkin models.

It is based on the Willits skin (by Tim Willits, aka GOD).
Why this skin? Because I think it is the best quake skin ever. Unlike
most, it is well made, has colour support, and isn't a cheap novelty
that grows tiresome after 5 minutes. Use it as your base skin in QW.

The player.mdl contains 16 different coloured variants of the skin.
The first 14 use the available colours for both pants and shirts.
Skin 15 is the default colours, and skin 16 uses the colours I use on this
skin in QuakeWorld. If you use a combination of bots and humans you should
modify the mdl so that skin 15 becomes skin 1.

The h_player.mdl (by me) contains 16 coloured gibbed
helmets to match the colours of the bots they were blown off of.

For The Uninitiated
-------------------
Put both the files in a progs directory in your bot folder (eg.
C:\Quake\Reaper\Progs) and run your bots normally.
Better yet, use PakExplorer to put the models in your pak#.pak files.

Credits
-------
All I did was make the skin into different colours (plus the
gibbed heads). The real credit goes to:

id (duh), in particular Tim Willits.
The makers of QuakeME and PakExplorer.
Steve Polge for the reaper bots (even if his attitude after joining Epic...).
You for reading this (and hopefully using the skins).


I would just like to say that this is the best multiskin pack for Q1
that I've seen. Honest.

I also have:
-an armor.mdl to match the skins.
-gfx.wad(s) to replace the head in the status bar with a cross (similar to
 to Q2). This way the status bar is skin independant.
-Pak3.pak for the CTF Bot. Bases the skins on the Willits skin. Changes
 the .mdls for the hook. Skin independant gfx.wad for status bar.
 Modified armor.mdl.
