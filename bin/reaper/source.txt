Do-it-yourself Reaper

I am sure most of you know this already, but I will tell you how to obtain the Reaper Source code.

First - download the Reaper Bot ver 0.81. I have it here. (164 KB)
http://www.mindspring.com/~win32ch/reaprb81.zip

Second - download the ProQcc compiler/decompiler. I have it here. (87 KB)
http://www.mindspring.com/~win32ch/proqc160.zip

Third - download the rip011a.txt file. I have it here. (34 KB) This text file will instruct you on how to decompile and create a readable, compilable Reaper source.

If this seems like too much work, here is the decompiled Reaper Bot source code (compressed down to 106 KB).
