Best 16 Skins for the Reaper Bots 2/7/97

Player16.mdl is a skins file for the Reaper Bots.
There are 16 skins that depict different characters.

Create a directory called PROGS in your ReaperBot 
directory. Place the player16.mdl file in that directory
and rename it Player.mdl.  Make sure you save or rename 
any other files you have named Player.mdl before you do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

When you start playing with the ReaperBots,
hit the "p" key to activate skins mode. "b" adds a
single reaperbot, "n" adds 4, etc.

The 16 different reaperbots will always cycle in
the same order. You must use MEDDLE or another
skins program to change the skins order.

Some of the 16 skins are.... Boba Fett, a Lizardman,
a Borg, a Stormtrooper, C3P0, Red Helmut, Egghead,
Goofy dude, Mexican Sombrero, Terminator, Predator,
Super Predator, Black Panther, Insect Man, and a
few more.

Some of the above names have been changed.

THANK YOU TO ALL THE SUPERB ARTISTS WHO CREATED THE
16 SKINS USED IN THIS FILE!!

Enjoy.
