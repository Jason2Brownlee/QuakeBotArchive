Type of Mod

MDL      : yes

What this is-
------------
This zipfile contains add-on skins for Reaperbot ver0.8 and above.

Thirteen of the Sixteen Skins in this mdl are used by current Quake
DeathMatch clans. 
 
From the Reaperbot text file:

	"The reaper bot assumes there are 16 skins in the player.mdl file
	(numbered 0 to 15).  Skin 0 should be the default quake skin.
	Skin 15 is what the "bot only" team uses if skins are enabled.  
	If the "show difficulty" mode is enabled, then skins 1 to 4
	will be associated with progressively higher skill levels (e.g. 
	skill 0 = skin 1, etc.).  For teamplay, the bots will share the skin of their human teammate if they aren't on the bot only team."
 
Skin 0 in this file is not the default quake skin, however. See below.

How To Install
--------------

Create a PROGS subdirectory under your Reaperbot directory and unzip the
contents of this zipfile there. If your Reaperbot directory is
C:\QUAKE\RPBOT, then this directory would be C:\QUAKE\RPBOT\PROGS.

Rename CLANRPSK.MDL to PLAYER.MDL and be sure to rename or copy your old
player.mdls that you may already have in this directory before doing this.

Read the Reaperbot txt file for the impulses to get them going.
Some reminders:
     Hitting the "p" key once allows the reaperbots to use the skins in regular mode.
     In this mode, the 16 skins enter in the order listed below.
 
     Hitting the "p" key a second time activates the skill based skins mode. For skill levels
     0.0 to 0.9, skin 1 will be used, 1.0 to 1.9 will use skin 2, 2.0 to 2.9 will use
     skin 3 and 3.0 will use skin 4. Also remember that "b" adds 1 bot, "n" adds 4, etc.

The order in which the skins appear (1st to 16th) may be changed by extracting
and importing the skins using skins editors such as QuakeMe and MedDle.

**There is no h_player.mdl in this file. Therefore the head gibs will default to the standard Quake player head.**

I hope you enjoy this reaperbot skins mdl and enjoy the cool looking skins
that the clans use on the web.

A note on selection- I tried for a variation of selection from the best
clan skins on the web. For example, there were four red color only skins
that I really liked. However, I only included skin 1 and skin 10 (red,
white and blue) for variation's sake. Skin 3 has red pants. Skin 8 was reddish
as well and so I darkened the palette so as to include that cool skin.
I included only a limited number of skins with uncovered human faces and
tried for variations in color as well. Also, I didn't want to go with allot of 
the skeleton skins, so I went with what I thought was the best one..skin 12 
here. Finally, I also tried to balance the amount of helmeted skins and bare-chested skins.

To VIEW other clan skins on the web, You should visit THE SKIN SHOP at
http://www.kinglink.com/clanskins/. Please read the copyright info there too.

Christopher Bolin's website (http://www.planetquake.com/skins/index.shtm) also has a very good collection of skins.

Enjoy! - [duglor]
