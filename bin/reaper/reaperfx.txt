**************
If you have any questions aboout this patch, please do not hesitate to e-mail me about it.
I answer all e-mail, and am very happy to hear from you.   :)


* Boilerplate information *

new sounds	        	: yeah
new monsters/weapons	: Yep
new QuakeC		      : Yes indeedy
new levels              : Yes 

* construction *

editor(s) used          : Wordpad & Proqcc (code), PsP (skins and graphics), Stoneless & Adquedit (maps and PAK management)
                          
build time		: A labour of love for several months

* installation *

Just unzip into d:\quake\reaperfx (or wherever)

and start quake with: quake -listen 16 -game reaperfx

********************************
*  the -listen 16 is important *
********************************

if quake quits with a message saying something like :
"overflow without allowoverflow set"
you can try using :
quake -listen 16 -game reaper -allowoverflow 1
and if you've got 32Mb RAM, -winmem 16 is DEFINATELY a good idea :^)

		o In Last Man Standing everybody starts with (fraglimit - 1) frags (or 10 frags if fraglimit == 0). When you get 		  killed. You lose a frag. When you have 0 frags left you're "out" and become an observer. The last person 		  standing is the winner. Simple huh?

		o In Teamplay 5, every team has it's own start position, and will always spawn there.
		  To use this mode your pants color MUST be in the range 0-13. It requires special maps
		  to use, currently ftb1.bsp supports this mode. Type "Teamplay 5" then "map ftb1" at
		  the console to use.

	Note you can mix deathmatch 5 and teamplay 5 if you want :^)

	o Deathmatch 5 (last man standing)
	o Teamplay 1 (as normal)
	o Teamplay 2 (weapons stay and you can kill teammates)
	0 Teamplay 5 (weapons stay, team starts, frag-the-barrel)
	o Coop 1 (as normal)

Maps in this patch:

Castles - cool DM level by me!
TMcastles - castles for deathmatch 5

=====================================================================

Impulses
okay here is how to work stuff. Bind them to some keys. (the keys in the supplied autoexec.cfg
and config.cfg are in brackets.)

BTW to play "Last Man Standing", type "deathmatch 5" at the console, then restart the level.

o add a bot 	: impulse 205 (b)
o add 4 bots 	: impulse 208 (n)
o add 15 bots	: impulse 115 (w)
o toggle observer	: impulse 212 (o)
o verbose bots	: impulse 215 (v)
o scores		: impulse 210 (m)
o top 3 scores	: impulse 222 (q)
o skin mode		: impulse 202 (p)
o skin up		: impulse 200 ([)
o skin down		: impulse 201 (])
o Laser targeter	: impulse 31 (0 zero)
o Random bot skill: impulse 30
o ammo casesON/OFF: impulse 50 (u)
o Call for help   : impulse 217 (h)

I think thats it. Look through the autoexec.cfg and config.cfg for any I've missed.
If you use the camoflage soldier skin the F1 - F8 keys to change the color of the skin

=====================================================================

Bugs  :^(
o The targeter status bar often doesn't update properly.
o Packet Overflows, if this happens turn off ejecting ammo cases with impulse 50 (u)
o no free edicts. Don't know how to fix this yet, happens most on coop (I think this is a fake message, I'm working on it)
o overflow without allowoverflow set. Don't know, If anyone DOES know how to fix this please mail me.
Please note most of these errors are caused by low memory, ReaperFX needs MORE than 32Mb RAM to run properly, MORE than
32Mb RAM, it usually runs OK on 32Mb run, but it may not.
=====================================================================

Please remember everytime I change something, I post a new version, this happens almost every day. This will never stop, I have already got the algorithm down to C++ for Quake II so watch my site!

That 's all folks.
