Changes from Beta 0.6 to Beta 0.7

----------------------------

* Restructured and improved goal selection AI

* Route cacheing structure and initial
implementation:  It doesn't do a whole lot yet,
but it will allow some *very cool* AI
improvements

* Bot understands trains -
adjusts jumps based on train velocity, and
stays on at least till next train target

* Made strafing more natural

* Support for bounding max number of
players + bots.  Impulse 1XX sets XX as the
max total number when in non-teamplay mode.

* Support for teamplay.  All non-aligned
bots belong to their own team (including any
added using impulse 205 or impulse 208).
Impulse 1XX sets to XX the number of bots
on each player's team.  Bots share the same
color and skin as their player teammate.
NOTE: Bot teamplay AI is not sophisticated
right now (basically = don't attack your
teammates).  Teamplay AI will be
substantially improved in future releases.

* Non-aligned bots have their own color,
different from all players.

* Skins support: Impulse 202 turns skins on,
Impulse 203 turns skins off.  Impulse 200
increments skins, Impulse 201 decrements
skins.  Thanks to Dennis Noordsji for the
original implementation.  (I wrote my own
code, but used his as a conceptual guide)

* Fixed the weird spawn point bug

* Fixed bot in low lava/slime not taking
damage bug

* Improved jumping AI - bot less likely
to jump into lava now

* Improved roaming AI

* Improved combat AI

* Bot takes advantage of radius damage-
if enemy goes around a corner, bot will
try to use rockets or grenades to hurt
enemy even if enemy is not visible.

* Observers don't pick up weapons

* Observers can use plats

* Improved bot wind tunnel handling

* Bots handle all start level stuff, and
skill teleports don't change skill

* Made skill 0 easier - Bots pause movement
when firing shotguns, slowed down avg. refire
rate

* Impulse 218 sets restricted mode - only client
0 can add bots, or go into observer mode.

* Impulse 219 sets super restricted mode -
no client can add bots or go into observer mode.

* Impulse 220 shows the normal frag score
(still shows break out of kills and deaths).

* Improved pain frames - bot won't stop attacking
when getting nailed (except maybe at skill 0)

* Bots are now respawned after any kind of
changelevel (not just when a player enters the
exit to a level)- except for changelevel typed
at console.

* Bots can trigger changelevel if they reach
the frag limit

* Added a config file, reaper.cfg, which sets
up aliases for the bot impulses, and assigns
some common ones to keys.  (Edit it to change
the key assignments)

* Better handling of quad power, and quad powered
opponents

* Bots will back off if they want to fire
their rocket launcher and opponent is too
close

* General code streamlining and efficiency
improvements

* Bots will chase enemies up wind tunnels

* Centerprint client when client enters level
- informs client of whether teamplay is active,
and the number of bots on the level

* Improved bot visibility check when enemy
is in water or partly obscured

* Random delay for bots entering level
(to avoid frag loops)

* Added messages every time bot respawns
if sv_aim or sv_maxspeed aren't normal
