What this is-
------------
This zipfile contains add on skins for Reaperbot ver0.8 and above. There are 2 skin files in this package, Player.mdl and H_player.mdl. The first contains the 16 different skins and the second is the skins for the head gibs. (Some of the heads are pretty weak, but you wont notice during play) 
These are some of the cooler skins I found on the net. I really enjoy playing with the Reaperbots, but sometimes you want to try something different, like watching Henry Rollins grenade the NYPD. Can't get enough of that, huh!
You can change the order with AdQuedit if you like, just remember to match up the heads.

The skins almost follow the Reaperbot skin guidelines as outline in Skinspec.txt. (The only difference is the replacement of the 1st player_mdl, I kind of got tired of the default Quake guy)
in the Reaperbot 0.8 package. Here is an excerpt:

	"The reaper bot assumes there are 16 skins in the player.mdl file
	(numbered 0 to 15).  Skin 0 should be the default quake skin.
	Skin 15 is what the "bot only" team uses if skins are enabled.  
	If the "show difficulty" mode is enabled, then skins 1 to 4
	will be associated with progressively higher skill levels (e.g. 
	skill 0 = skin 1, etc.).  Otherwise, the bots will during deathmatchplay choose any skin between 0 and 15.  For teamplay, of course,the bots will share the skin of their human teammate if they aren't on the bot only team."


How To Install
--------------

Create a PROGS subdirectory under your Reaperbot directory and unzip the
contents of this zipfile there. If your Reaperbot directory is
C:\QUAKE\RPBOT, then this directory would be C:\QUAKE\RPBOT\PROGS.
Read the Reaperbot txt file for the impulses to get them going.
