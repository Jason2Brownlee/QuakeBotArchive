What's This?
------------
This zipfile contains addon skins for Reaperbot ver0.8 and above. There are
2 skin files in this package, Player.mdl and H_player.mdl. The first
contains the 16 different skins and the second is the skins for the head
gibs. Skins #1-4 are the Skill skins by  Steve C. Clark. These look like
the QuakeGuy skin except that they have different skin color and wear cool
metallic blue custom armor. Skin #15 is the BGHURT skin from BGBOT 2.0a and
the rest are just the QuakeGuy wearing differently colored shirts and
pants.

The skins follows the Reaperbot skin guidelines as outline in Skinspec.txt
in the Reaperbot 0.8 package. In case you haven't got it handy, here is an
excerpt:


	"The reaper bot assumes there are 16 skins in the player.mdl file
	(numbered 0 to 15).  Skin 0 should be the default quake skin.
	Skin 15 is what the "bot only" team uses if skins are enabled.  
	If the "show difficulty" mode is enabled, then skins 1 to 4
	will be associated with progressively higher skill levels (e.g. 
	skill 0 = skin 1, etc.).  Otherwise, the bots will during deathmatch
	play choose any skin between 0 and 15.  For teamplay, of course,
	the bots will share the skin of their human teammate if they aren't
	on the bot only team."

That about explains it.

How To Install
--------------

Create a PROGS subdirectory under your Reaperbot directory and unzip the
contents of this zipfile there. If your Reaperbot directory is

Author Information

This is my first public release. I made a few DOOM Wads with DCK (very good
editor), but it just for fun and never released them.

I live in Singapore and am currently a conscripted soldier (6 more months
to go...) My PC is a Cyrix P150+ with 16 MB EDO RAM and 1.2 Gig Quantum
harddisk. First PC game I ever played was Wolf3d on my old Cyrix 486DLC
(That CPU Sucked BIG TIME!) Have come a long way since then...8-)
