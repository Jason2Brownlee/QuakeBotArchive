Changes from beta 0.75 to beta 0.8
-----------------------------

* Bots keep their individual skill level
on level change (only first 5 bots,
because of parm space limitations)

* Improved team AI - teammate bots
will call for help, or warn other bots
to run away

* Improved running away

* Improved chase, using routing.
How long bot chases enemy depends
on skill.

* Improved handling of multiple
enemies - bot picks who to fight,
and may decide to run away

* Improved route caching
	- bots are less likely to
get distracted if seeking something
they really want.
	- better route update
propagation.
	- age entries in bot route cache.
	- improved route following
through teleports.

* Better sidestepping if run into corner
of wall, or teammate

* If skill == 1 (the console skill setting,
not the individual bot skill), then bots
auto-adjust their skill based on
sucess/failure against players

* Added a support for the skin spec -
non-player team bots use skin 15, and
with skins mode 2, bot skin is based
on skill level

* Improved water movement

* Reduced telefrag loops - bots delay
respawn after they've been telefragged

* Low skill bots (< 2) have poorer
z axis (up/down) vision

* Made skill 3 bot more lethal -
better aiming and strafing

* Bot understands that lightning gun
has limited range

* Basic bot "hearing" implemented -
bots react to nearby noises at higher
skills

* Added support for dedicated servers

* Fixed go for secret doors by bots
(broke in 0.75)

* Reaper.cfg is now named autoexec.cfg
in the archive, so it automatically runs
(rename it if you don't want it).

* Implemented crude edict management.
Its not perfect, but it should reduce the
crashes due to no free edicts.

* Lower than skill 1 bots can't strafe
to items - they have to turn and run to
them.

* Improved jumping AI
