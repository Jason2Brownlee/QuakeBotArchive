- setup info

  Print out this Readme.txt. Unzip RBCFG10.ZIP into the c:\quake\rpbot
  or the subdirectory where your Reaper Bot files reside.
            
  When using the Reaper Bot the commandline should look like:

           quake -game rpbot -listen +skill 1

  Once in the game bring down the console and type "exec reaper.cfg"
  minus the quotes. You can put this command at the end of your
  autoexec.cfg or config.cfg to run this script automatically.

  Featuring an actual learning and adaptive AI, this is definitely the
  best Quake deathmatch bot produced to date. If you have tried this
  bot, then you know there are quite a few impulses to configure and
  to remember. For my REAPER.CFG I have also included the following
  aliases giving you some administrative functions to make setting up
  a bot game that much easier:

  - (F1) adds 1 bot and (F2) adds 4 bots. Refer to the original
    documentation for editing 'add 3 team bots', (F3).

    - When teamplay is set I would press (F2) for 4 opposing bots and
      (F3) to add 3 bots on my team.
 
  - A Skill Selector (k and l) - lower and higher respectively; to
    query current skill setting press (j); the Skill script contains
    fractional values allowing you to really find a suitable skill
    level to play with the bot

  - Noexit toggle (b); this function, plus Fraglimit and Timelimit,
    are automatically disabled when Singleplayer (,) is invoked

  - Fraglimit (n); Cycles up to 50 frags; you can edit this script to
    add more values if you wish

  - Timelimit (m); Cycles up to 60 mins; you can edit this script to
    add more values or change the time increments if you wish

  - Playmode Selectors have been added to allow you to set up specific
    game types without having to go to the menu or the console. (,)
    selects Single Player. (.) selects Deathmatch and toggles between
    mode 1 and 2. (/) selects Teamplay and cycles 4 modes of play.

    - After setting up your specified game with fraglimit, skill, etc.,
      use the restart key (HOME) to allow all updated settings to take
      effect. You can also use (END) to disconnect from your game.

    - If you are using multiskin remember to toggle on Skins (p) after
      restarting a level.

  - Top 3 scores (TAB) replaces the default +showscores hud. I have
    added the regular bot score table (BACKSPACE) which brings down
    the console for viewing.

- Other Things

  This particular script is taken from my Network Script v4.0 which
  also contains a support script for playing on Threewave Capture
  servers. If you would like to get <qcfg40.zip> you can find it at
  ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/console or you contact me for it.

  Mike Kelly (elkabong@oanet.com) has made a Reaper Bot Skins file
  <reaprskn.zip> which allows you to play against the bots with dif-
  ferent colored player skins creating the illusion of a real death-
  match. You can find this file and The Reaper Bot <reaprb75.zip> at
  ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/quakec/bots.
