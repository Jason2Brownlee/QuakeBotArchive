=============================
THIS IS FROGBOT NETQUAKE MOD
=============================

=========
OVERVIEW
=========
Read these files: /manuals/*.txt


=================================
New Botmatch.dat (progs.dat) features
=================================
--Buttons support (works great on dm1 and dm5 maps)
--Full water support (bots will swim almost like real players).
--Basic buttons support.
--Advanced match features : overtime support,accuracy stats support
(available at any part of the game),quadstats - quad weapon
efficiency,high score table(available at the end of matches).Overtime
toggles ONLY if 2 players or bots or 2 teams (with teamnames).
--QW KT-style comments during game(like team[xxx] leads by xx
frags),etc..
--Auto-loading bots. Bots will try to connect and then disconnect
after user-definable time-limit.
--BugFIXES: - Completely removed all NULL-function FATALITIES.
- Memory leak fixes.
- Cache mismatch in GL. (thx qsg.telefragged.com).
- Console typing enhancements (insert mode by default).
- Allows multiple connections from a single IP address.
- Precise aim for clients (controllable with cl_cross_x and
cl_cross_y cvars).
- Larger console buffer.
--Cool logging support.When timelimit or fraglimit is reached,if
'autostats' cvar enabled - engine logging advanced players and bots
statistics.Logging format you may see in 'newcmds.cfg'.Log example you
may found at ./stats/(hostport)/. This feature is very useful for
stats lovers - like me :)
--Bots teamnames now shows on scoreboard (including their teamfrags
and etc..).
--Markers improovements:DM3 - water way and ring-quad jumping;DM6: RJ
from GA to cells;other listed maps - rocketjump (see maplist).
--Advanced evasive strategies. Toggle is 'botevade'. Enabled by
default.
--Good CAMPING AI. (dm6 and dm3 so far..). Toggle is 'botcamp'.
Enabled by default.
--Bots will automatically try to help any teammate in their team if he
close enough and really needs help. Toggle is 'bothelp'. Enabled by
default.
--Improoved think function (water code related).
--Identify teammate function.Idea taken from Q2 OSP-Tourney Mod.If
'ident' is enabled,there's a short sentence appears at the bottom on
status-bar ,looks like "teammate [9]Xenon".
--Bots will report their status and locations if 'botreport'is enabled
and loc-file loaded. Available in teamplay only. Location names called
from loc-files in moddir/locs
--Talk abilities.Including RUSSIAN TALKS :)) and English talks..
--Gibfilter (low and high)- 'highgibs' and 'lowgibs' cvars.
--New GIBS models.
--32-bit dat-file.
--Extended obituaries.
--Lavajumping feature (rocketjump from lava).
--'Shot for luck' feature (sometimes bots shooting from RL for luck,
even if enemy is not visible).
--Shotable buttons and doors support.
--Other minor features i forgot to mention.


====================================================
New GL-(WIN-)BOTMATCH.EXE (gl(win)quake.exe) features
====================================================

--Synthetic lag. One of the coolest feature..
--Watervis hacks.
--User-definable teamnames (like in QW)
--New cvars (see 'newcmds.cfg').Type 'cvarlist'.
--Advanced deathmatch scoreboard. Ripped from QW,but added
'rank','eff','blunders' (in teamplay).
--User-definable MOTD (loading from ./dmmotd.txt).
--Other cosmetic improovements.


=========================
Important notes
=========================
--Do not use old Frogbot names editors (like fbedit.exe), cos it's not
understand "teamname=" option. Due to that fact, botfiles always will
be created with error in "lines="..
--Do Not use ANY gl(win)quake.exe,quake*.exe,and etc - game WILL
crash, cause I've changed pr_global_struct and network protocol. Do
not try also use ANY of coming up other exe's (the game will not work
properly).
--Do NOT rename botmatch.dat to progs.dat - game WILL crash.
--Do NOT use decompiler - ask me for source if needed !!


==================
Teamnames Support
==================
If you want spawn a bot with teamname visible on status bar open any
bot-file (in bots folder) and edit file directly by adding folowing
lines:
wait;teamname=
wait;impulse 54 // "6"
wait;impulse 54 // "6"
wait;impulse 54 // "6"
wait;impulse_0 //end teamname
Don't forget to modify "lines=" parameter.



==========================
Creating/Modifying Marker
==========================
I have included simple config file with waypoints editing commands
(wpedit.cfg).
There's a demofile also demontrates the way to place waypoints on
maps.

=============================
SUPPORTED MAPS

Starting GAME
================

gl-botmatch.exe -heapsize XXXXX -game <moddir> -width XXX -height
XXX -bpp XX -listen XX -zone 2048 -allowoverflow 1 -ip
XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX -longcoords

The -longcoords switch allow you to switch PROTOCOL_VERSION byte to
7..This hack is intended to use on large maps.
