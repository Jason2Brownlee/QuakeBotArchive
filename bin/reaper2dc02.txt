Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
!IMPORTANT! - This mod will be of no use for ordinary PC-users, it's made for Quake DC only!

This is the famous ReaperBot merged with the popular DC port of Quake. Now, even users
without keyboard or good knowledge in Quake can meet the deathmatch enemies in all the
standard deathmatch arenas.

How to Install the Modification (DC only!)
------------------------------------------
Be sure that you have both pak0.pak and pak1.pak from the full retail version of
quake before you contiue any further!

1. Download this .zip (reaper2dc.zip)
2. Unzip the progs.dat file included within it, it doesn't matter where.
3. Use your favorite .pak editor and overwrite the original progs.dat file in pak0.pak
   with the new one you just extracted.
4. Save the pak.
5. Burn DC Quake on a cd as told in the readme.
6. PLAY! ;)

How to play the Modification
----------------------------
1. Start up the game on your DC.
2. Choose "single-player game".
3. Wait.
4. When you join the game a couple of bots automaticly joins and will fight you and
   the other bots. The game goes on for 5 minutes, then the maps rotate and the
   procedure repeates. There is no specific goal of the game, just some happy
   fragging :)

Although Steven Polge make clear that his bots may not be changed or modified
in any way for public use, this mod only modifies minor details in non-bot
code to make the bots work on the Dreamcast-version of Quake. The ReaperBot code
itself is still intact and unmodified. If the author still is unhappy with
the mod, I will with no further notice take it offline. ;)
