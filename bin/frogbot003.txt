About the mod
-------------

The Frogbot mod is my continuing attempt to create a bot that is
believably human. I judge my efforts soley on the game product you
play, and not on some theoretic discussions of AI implementation
methods.

The current AI of the Frogbot is what I would regard as a minimal
working model. I do intend to greatly improve it over time. Though it
is true that QuakeC presents limitations of all sorts, by using a bit
of ingenuity I have been able to push QuakeC to the limits.

The first requirement of a 'human' bot, as opposed to a 'bot' bot, is
fluent navigational skills. With the sacrifice of using static
waypoints the Frogbot can achieve fluent navigation around a level,
and moreover can actually be programmed in QuakeC (this is assuming
todays relatively slow cpu speeds).

The Frogbot is a 99.9% client emulation bot. To my knowledge it is the
only QuakeC bot that accomplishes this. The missing 0.1% is that the
Frogbot on rare occasions can get stuck on or near steps (if I didn't
say this you may have never known this :).

I have decided to make my so far incomplete efforts available to the
Quake community so that other people can share in the enjoyment of
playing the Frogbot.


How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

Create a directory called frogbot as a subdirectory in your Quake
directory and unzip frogbot003.zip into it. Include the paramter
"-game frogbot" in your Quake command. This version does not require
any additional player.mdl skin file.

If you wish to record a demo of the Frogbot make sure that when you
replay it you do so with the "-game frogbot" parameter in your Quake
command.
