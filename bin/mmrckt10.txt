บ  Description of the Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

Mod changes the regular Rocket Launcher to fire in multiple modes.
These modes include:
	1)	Rocket Mode(regular Quake Rockets)
	2)	Homing Mode(Similar to Vhold Homing missiles)
	3)	Pod Mode(Fires three Regular Rockets in a spread)
	4)	Homing Pod Mode(Fires three Homing Rockets in a spread)
	5)	Dog Launcher Mode?!?!?!(thats right...Dog)
			(Fires a reduced-damage rocket which on explosion spawns a 
			 regular Quake Dog)
	6)	Homing Dog Launcher Mode?!?!?!(thats right...Homing Dog)
			(Fires a reduced-damage homing rocket which on explosion spawns a 
			 regular Quake Dog. Does NOT home on dogs.)

บ  How to use Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

Two methods:
	1)	Create an extra directory under \quake and copy the progs.dat
		file there. Run quake with the -game parameter and the directory
		just created.

	2)	Modify the QuakeC source code and compile, creating a new
		progs.dat.

Game Usage:
	I added no special impulses. Use is simple.	
	1) Get the Rocket Launcher.
	2) Rocket Launcher defaults to Rocket Mode.
	3) Press 7 key repeatedly to cycle through modes.
	4) Fire after desired mode is chosen.
	5) Enjoy the results.

Ammo requirements:
	1) Rocket Mode 		- 1 Rocket
	2) Homing Mode 		- 2 Rockets
	3) Pod Mode 		- 3 Rockets
	4) Homing Pod Mode 	- 8 Rockets
	5) Dog Mode 		- 2 Rockets
	6) Homing Dog Mode 	- 4 Rockets

Play Notes:
	1) Be careful when firing DOG MISSILES. The dogs usually will attack the
	nearest target(Hopefully your target). If they don't find a target,
	they will wander around until finding one. They WILL attack you. These dogs
	are not much different than the regular Quake dogs.
	2) The DOG modes are more for fun.
	3) POD mode packs a huge punch.
	4) HOMING mode can be powerful but Homing missiles can be avoided by a
	good player.
	5) HOMING POD mode is devastating. That's why it costs 8 rockets. The
	target is sometimes destroyed by 1 or 2 missiles. The remaining missile(s) then
	home on another target if available.

บ  Technical Details  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออผ

NOTES:
	1) Sometimes dogs will not spawn. This is because the DogSpawnCheck function
	(CUJO Spawn Check) indicated there was no position for the dog to safely spawn.
	2) HOMING DOG MISSILES will NOT home on other dogs.  This is by design. 
	I found in testing that the HOMING DOG MISSILES will invariably choose the
	Dogs as targets and home in on them and destroy them.
	3) 1 above is interesting since it adds in a reliability factor into missiles...
	ie. sometimes weapons don't always work quite right, like in real life.
	4) The dogs have 40 points health as opposed to the default of 25 points.
	5) The dogs are about half the size of the regular dogs.
	

KNOWN Bugs:(Will I fix these...? Don't know... kind of like them.)
	1) When firing DOG MISSILES, sometimes the Spawned Dog will appear
	in the target. No other effects that I can tell.
	2) When firing HOMING DOG MISSILES, sometimes the Spawned Dog will appear
	in the target. No other effects that I can tell.
	3) 1 and 2 above result from the DogSpawnCheck function	(CUJO Spawn Check) 
	which sometimes reports back a bad position. The code is fine for CUJO but
	not always for the missiles which can be in any position unlike a player.
	4) Sometimes when firing DOG MISSILES, the rocket targets the spot where
	the last missile impacted. Don't really understand this one.

Future Revisions:
	1) May change the Cost of firing rockets for certain modes; ie.
	HOMING,POD,HOMING POD.
	2) Anything else I can think of...
