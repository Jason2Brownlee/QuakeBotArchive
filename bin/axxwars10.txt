Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

Short: Another Quake Combo patch. I presume you know how to compile Qcc. If not, mail me. 

Feat:	Deathmatch, Single Player, Teamgames, It, Capture the flag, King of the Hill, Headhunt, Monstermash, Axxfest.
	Bots, Seekers, Guided missiles, Snipers, Realistic weapons, Holos, Pipebombs, Cameras, Remote Admin, Observer
	Airfist, Runes, Morphing, Harpoons, Proxmines, Throwing Axes, Blazegun, Camperkiller, Random Item respawn,   	  	Restricted weapons, Cujo, Flares, Sniperscope, Feign Death, Fragreports, Haste, Jumping, Gravity Changes.
	And lots more.

Need: 	To use this patch you'll need a player.mdl with 16 skin, in which skin 14 is reserved for the It! player, and skin 15 and 16 are for team 1 and team 2 respectively. I didn't add this to decrease the size of the archive and because every player has his own favourite skins anyway.
