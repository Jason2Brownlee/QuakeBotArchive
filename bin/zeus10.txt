บ  Description of the Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

This mod creates a helper bot which will attack the player's
enemies and draw fire.  The bot attacks with a Lightning Gun,
which will not harm the player if he runs into it.

This bot is based in a big way on original code from DM Bot 1.0.

บ  How to use Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

Impulse 100  Activates and Deactivates the bot

Impulse 101  Toggles between Automatic and Manual Control Modes

Impulse 102  Auto: Fires Weapon
             Manual: Toggle bot movement-Stop/Walk/Run

Impulse 103  Auto: Toggle auto-fire
             Manual: Turn left

Impulse 104  Auto: Teleport to player
             Manual: Turn right

Impulse 105  Toggles the bot's glow status.

Impulse 106  Reports the bot's status.

Bind these impulses to keys to make commanding the bot easy.  For example,
to make the Q key activate and deactivate the bot put this line in your
config.cfg file (or type it in the Quake console):

BIND Q "IMPULSE 100"

Now, every time you press Q the bot will be toggled between his active and
inactive state.  You can bind the other impulses in a similar manner.

บ  How to Install the Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ


Unzip ZEUS10.ZIP into a temporary directory and run INSTALL.BAT
with the full path of your Quake directory.  For example, if Quake
is located in C:\GAMES\QUAKE then you would type:

INSTALL C:\GAMES\QUAKE

This will install the necessary files in a directory called ZEUS10
which is inside of your Quake directory, and also create a batch
file in the Quake directory called ZEUSBOT.BAT which will run the
modified version of Quake.

If you are interested in seeing how this was done, you can manually
unzip the file SOURCE.ZIP which was contained inside ZEUS10.ZIP
and look at the modified source.  If you would like to make your
own Quake C mods, get QCC.ZIP and read the instructions contained
within it.  Also, find one of the many web pages with info about
Quake modifications to learn more.

บ  Technical Details  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออผ

Features:

 The bot can draw enemy fire, lessening the amount of damage the player
  takes.

 Seeks out monsters or other players and attacks them.

 Will continue to attack as long as an enemy target is visible.

 Will not attack teammates under Teamplay rules.

 ZeusBot can follow the player through portals.

 ZeusBot will activate trigger fields (such as light triggers and traps)

 ZeusBot starts with a full suit of red armor.

 ZeusBot cannot be injured by your shotgun blasts, axe, or thunderbolts,
  but you can hurt him with nailguns and rockets, so keep this in mind
  when firing at an enemy your faithful companion is already tearing to
  pieces.

 ZeusBot is equipped with a special device based on slipgate technology.
  Should he become separated from you, you can teleport him to your own
  location instantly.  ZeusBot is even smart enough to activate this device
  on his own when the distance becomes very great.

 ZeusBot fires the Thunderbolt weapon instead of the super nailgun.  It
  doesn't seem to kill things quite as fast, but you can't be hit by his
  beam, which is a big improvement.

 ZeusBot can glow, effectively lighting up everything around you.  You can
  turn this on and off, so as not to give away your position in deathmatch.

 ZeusBot can say a total of 6 taunting remarks when it chooses a target
   for destruction.  During deathmatch, it will even insult other players
   by name.

 ZeusBot runs quite a bit more now than he did previously.  Whenever the
   player is more than 100 units away the bot will sprint towards him.

Bugs:

 ZeusBot does not jump or walk past edges.

 ZeusBot sometimes gets lost.  Okay.  Maybe it happens pretty often.

 ZeusBot is not deactivated after a level change, I don't think, but I think
  the Quake code will dispose of it's entity memory anyway (tell me if I'm
  wrong, please).

 The thunderbolt does not always appear at the end of ZeusBot's gun, and
  I'm not really sure why.  It's still cool, though.

 Please email about any other bugs!

บ  Future Enhancements  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออผ

None for now.  This was just a project to get familiar with Quake C.  But,
you can email me if you have any cool ideas for improvements.
