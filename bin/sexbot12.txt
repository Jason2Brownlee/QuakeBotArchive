attention     : NO ONE UNDER 18 SHOULD INSTALL OR VIEW THIS MOD.

title         : SexBOT (X-rated cooperative Quake BOT)
filename      : sexbot12.zip
author        : esoteric
date:         : 4-06-99
quakeC        : yes
.qc file      : yes, BOT files
new sounds    : yes, various babes
progs.dat     : yes, v1.06
pak0.pak      : yes
new MDLs      : yes, enforcer and quad
new BSP       : no

Description   : Yet another variation of TM Bot, it gives you a nude female mascot 
                bot named 'SexBOT'. SexBOT has her own model file and texture, 
                based on the Enforcer Model SexDroid (created by Bruce Krueger). 
                Just activate SexBOT and she'll be completely automated.

                SexBOT also notifies which monster she attacks, and informs you once 
                that monster is killed.

                Instead of being armed with only an enforcer laser, SexBOT is packing 
                a rocket launcher for long distance enemies, and a nailgun that she 
                likes to use up close.
               
                I have also incorporated all my SexQuake (sexqke10.zip) monsters into 
                this SexBOT mod. All the anatomically detailed x-rated females from 
                SexQuake are here too. The enforcer and quad damage MDLs are work by 
                Bruce Krueger. They are a great improvement over the original Quake 
                MDLs. I have only enhanced Bruce's character skins. Includes many new 
                replacement female sounds to enhance gameplay. 

Female Models : Idealized, centerfold proportioned, generic sexy nude female 
                characters, replacing almost every original Quake character.

Known Bugs    : my recompiled progs.dat gives a misc_fireball error in the start map
                and other maps dealing with fireballs, when loading. This error does 
                not affect gameplay but there are no random lavaballs bouncing out 
                of the lava.

Other esoteric creations: SexQuake v1.0 (sexqke10.zip) which can be found at
                          ftp.cdrom.com/pub/quake/partial_conversions/xrated
                          and other mirrors.

work. If you do so, please give me (esoteric) credit for my time spent and

====================================================================================


* Installation *

Make a directory in your Quake folder called "sexbot"

Then, unzip the file in that directory. After that, run:

	
        c:\quake\quake -game sexbot
	
                   - or -

        use the runmod.bat file (edit as needed)         


If everything installed correctly, you should see a bunch
of nude female monsters in the game. Just start the game 
as you normally would and play SexBOT :-)

The demos have been disabled by default. Edit the quake.rc
file if you wish to watch the demos with all nude female 
monsters.


================================================================

* How to use Modification *

When you start SexBOT, the control keys are automatically 
configured to the default keys below:

Q  Activate SexBOT / Deactivate SexBOT
W  Automatic mode / Manual mode

 Automatic mode commands :
 E  Fire Weapon
 R  Toggle Auto-Fire
 Y  Teleport to Player (you)

 Manual mode commands :
 E  Toggle movement: Stop/Walk/Run
 R  Turn Left
 Y  Turn Right

To change these settings, modify the QUAKE.RC file that
comes with this patch, and change the following lines:

bind q "impulse 100"
bind w "impulse 101"
bind e "impulse 102"
bind r "impulse 103"
bind y "impulse 104"


==========================================================================

* Technical Details *

 Features:

        1. Manual or automatic control of SexBOT
        2. SexBOT can draw enemy fire
        3. SexBOT can activate trigger fields on the floor (like
	   the lights on E1M1 when going down the spiral ramp).
        4. SexBOT can go through teleport portals
        5. SexBOT tries to return when you get too far away
        6. SexBOT possesses a rocket launcher for long distance, and a
           nailgun for close up work
        7. SexBOT has her own custom model file, and new sounds
        8. SexBOT informs you of which monster she is attacking, and also 
           informs you when / if she kills them.
       
 Coding Bugs:

        1. SexBOT will accidently shoot you if you get in the way,
           between her and the target (which will usually kill you
           considering the power level of her weapons) !!
        2. SexBOT cannot push buttons on the wall
        3. SexBOT cannot jump
        4. SexBOT cannot walk over broken ground.
        5. SexBOT sometimes gets lost (dumb blond syndrome)
	6. Certain functions (i.e. teleport, move, etc.)
	   interrupt the dying process giving you a ghost SexBOT
	   that is unsubstantial and unkillable
        7. Level changes may not be handled correctly by the code
	   (SexBOT may not be deactivated, just lost)
        8. Changing your color during gameplay after you've activated
           SexBOT can be hazardous, as SexBOT will then proceed to attack
           you! (It's you going up against your own bot)
