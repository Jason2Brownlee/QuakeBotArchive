Many thanks to ID for this superb game.


Update:Bots now use the Homing Missile Launcher

Nuke Grenage added, collect 20 grenades / rockets, press
'G' or 'IMPULSE 90' and BOOM (kills all in the area - huge area)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Combines:-

Deathmatch Bots (max of 12 - depending on mem)
Comrade Bots (AI is not perfected yet)
Start with Shotguns, but dont let these guys
get Homing Rocket Launchers or Armour, they are tough.
when they kill you your frag will -1
so you can keep track of score.
Bots can jump
Bots frags are displayed when they die


Tractor Beam (Lightning gun changes mode)
Pipebomb (weapon 6 toggles)
Prox Mines (weapon 7 toggles)
Ammo needed for prox mines & pipebombs - 5 grenades
Texture for grenade can be changed (invisible mines!)
Timed Grenades for normal launcher
(type Temp1 x (x is time) at console)

Nuke Grenades - Wipe out an entire team!

Zombies on walls can be gibbed

Electro Bomb (throw into water, 5 secs, fried enemies)

Laser rifle (replaces shotgun)
Tough weapon, but it eats shotgun ammo.
When used in combination with Quad Damage
fires tons of lasers.

Lightbomb
Throw this a room and watch'em run for the exit
Blinds all in prox for 15 seconds, easy targets! (not bots)

Extra Gibs
Twice as much gore, Three times as much
on Shamber & Fiend

Power Axe
Twice as strong as before, actually worth using
when you have ammo!

Sticky Homing Missiles
Home in to enemy, sticks up arse, then blows up after approx 3 secs
watch the smoke trails as they run! (COOL)

Give a Backpack
Face your team mate and press T (impulse 55)

Foot steps for deathmatch

Flame Thrower (weapon 5 toggles)
NOTE: You have to have the Super Nail Rifle & Grenade Launcher
(both these combine to give flame thrower)

Uses rocket fuel, works on players, monsters
but not bots (metal)

If your on fire, jump into some water
