Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

This modification will add another level to Cameron Newham's Eliminator Bot.
The level is E1M7. Can you say Gib-a-licious?

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

1.  If you don't have the Eliminator Bot, this mod will do nothing for you. :)
    You can get the latest version of the Eliminator Bot from:
      ftp.cdrom.com in the Quake C area under bots/eliminator

2.  The method to convert my MAP files to BSP form is the same as outlined 
    in the README.TXT of the eliminator bot package.  That is, you will
    require a PAK unpacker to extract E1M7.BSP.  You will also need a utility
    such as QBSP or QDTOOLS to insert the entities MAP into the BSP.

Technical Details
-----------------
Bug?    Sometimes when a cbot falls into the lava, it won't die and will
        run around in the pool immune to all punishment.
