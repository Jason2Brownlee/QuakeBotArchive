Description             : QHenge is great, its fast, simple and alot
			  of fun, but wait theres more!  Now with
			  Eliminator code bring on gibbed death madness!
			  Mod includes basic eliminator code, not much 
			  really, just enough to make it fun.  Also
			  Qhenge now sports a lightning gun instead of
			  a rocketlauncher, an extra nailgun or two
                          some armor, and more ammo.  

			  Moved some deathmatch spots around.
                          
			  Play with at least 2-3 Eliminators.

Known Bugs      : My simple waypoint patterns for these guys leaves them
		  circling at times.
		  In general they seem to be near sighted.

How to, what to do:  Just put the qhenge.bsp in your quake/elim/maps directory.
