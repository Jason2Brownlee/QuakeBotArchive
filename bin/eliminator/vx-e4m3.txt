Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

This modification will add level E4M3 to Cameron Newham's Eliminator Bot.
Lotsa rockets, quads(5!), invis rings(4)...

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
1.  You can get the latest version of the Eliminator Bot from:
      ftp.cdrom.com in the Quake C area under bots/eliminator

2.  The method to convert my MAP files to BSP form is the same as outlined
in the README.TXT of the eliminator bot package.  That is, you will require
a PAK unpacker to extract E4M3.BSP.  You will also need a utility such as
QBSP or QDTOOLS to insert the entities MAP into the BSP.

*For those wanting to know how to extract the entities from the .BSP files,
I used qdtool10.zip at ftp.cdrom.com /pub/idgames2/utils/bsp_pak_tools

Technical Details
-----------------
1.0
    -Level comes with only 4 deathmatch spots; I added four more.  If you
don't like them or want to change them, they're at the end of the MAP
textfile.

    -Did not implement the sliding floor area for the cbots.  They do stomp
on that floor trigger tho..

    -Created way too many waypoints..had to strip out about 70 of 'em. :)
Even so, it still cannot handle more than 7 cbots(one user) for a long
period of time and will crash with an 'Out of Edicts' error.  The quake
console command, EDICTCOUNT will show how many edicts are being used.  When
the edicts hit 450..say goodnight. :)
