Common Bugs
-----------
There are a couple of bugs so far in this level
Okay the first one is that while the bots are in the water
and they pick up the lightning gun they try to shoot you
but when they shoot you u think fuck discharged but no its
normal they shoot the lightning gun as if they were out side
The second one is that they cant get the red armour
and the lucky last (I hope) is that they cant pick up the
100% health near the super nailgun.
If you see or find and other bugs please email us thankz

The Fixed one will be ready to grab Soon!!

Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

  This map simply allows you to use the Eliminator bots with DM3 which
  is the best of the best deathmatch levels id released

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

Just put dm3.bsp into your eliminator/maps directory (or whatever you
call your eliminator dir.).  I'm sure you know how to run it if you have
the bots, but here's the startup command anyway:
  quake -game eliminator +map dm3
