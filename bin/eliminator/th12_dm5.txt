Name of file: DM5.MAP (formerly THETADM5)

INTRODUCTION
  This is a DM5.MAP file for use with Cameron Newham's impressive 
Eliminator Deathmatch Bot(s).  It does, of course, require QBSP.EXE 
(go find it . . . nobody gave ME one) as well as a copy of DM5.BSP 
from QUAKE\ID1\PAK1.PAK.  It is assumed that the end user of this 
file already knows how to make a Quake map Eliminator-ready; if not, 
get the Eliminator patch and read Mr. Newham's instructions.  
It's NOT MY JOB to baby-walk you through every step of the procedure.

  These bots know all the main paths in this map, and will deviate 
from those paths as it suits them.  Most of the time this involves 
the bots detecting a waypoint to a weapon they'd like to have (I made
full use of the "items" attribute in Mr. Newham's bot engine, so you'll
usually find most of the killing taking place in the vicinity of the 
rocket launcher, the lightning gun, and the area with the gold armor and 
the super nailgun.)  They will also leap into the teleports when it suits
them.  Other than running for priority items, the bots are (adequately)
unpredictable. 

ALTERATIONS
  I always liked the super shotgun when deathmatching in Doom II, so I
added it to this map.  There are two, essentially in the same corridor
but on different levels.  No waypoints direct the bots to these shotguns,
but they'll pick them up anyway if they want one.

MAKING AN "EVEN PLAYING FIELD"
  Due to a limitation in Newham's bot engine, I was unable to 
make the bots swim up to the ledge where the lightning gun, cells, and 
Pentacle would normally be on this level (Mr. Newham may say what he likes, 
but I followed his instructions PRECISELY, and STILL the bots insist on 
walking the floor rather than swimming.)  For this reason, I have MOVED 
the gun, ammo, and powerup to the floor of the underwater room, easily 
accessible by human and bot alike.  This also means that if you need a 
place to hide out and take a breather, the (now empty) ledge in that room 
is perfect (as long as an invulnerable and lightning gun-toting Eliminator 
isn't waiting for you under the water when you're ready to rejoin the 
fray!)  It seemed the only way to make the game fair (for the bots) . . . 

HOWEVER,
  In addition to their inability to swim, the bots ALSO seem able to 
breathe water (I haven't seen one drown yet) and to be IMMUNE to the 
effects of firing a lightning gun underwater (self-electrocution.)  This 
is inherently unfair (for the player!) and I see no workaround for it.  
Unfortunately, Mr. Newham has, as far as I can tell, abandoned the Cbot 
project and moved on to other things (for more complete information, 
visit his page at http://www.iinet.com.au/~cam/quakec.html if you haven't 
already.)  Just take some comfort from the fact that if YOU fire the 
lightning gun underwater, you'll waste the bots as well as yourself.  
There's always that Pentacle to even things up.  Enjoy!
