Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

This modification will add one more level to Cameron Newham's Eliminator Bot.
The level is called House of Desolation (see accompanying text file).

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

1.  If you don't have the Eliminator Bot, this mod will do nothing for you. :)
    You can get a version of the Eliminator Bot from:
      ftp.cdrom.com in the Quake C area under Bots\eliminator

2.  Unzip the archive into your elim\maps directory.  Run game using the +map
    deso parameter along with the others you use to run the eliminator bots.

Technical Details
-----------------
Deso-      I did a much better job on this than my first eliminator bot map :).
           The bots are plotted to run through the level completely in BOTH
           directions, so they will aggressively pursuit you!.  Lots of
           intense action and great with 10 bots on a fast machine :), and
           much fun with only 3 or 4. Created for H2H BBS, Cameron Newham,
           and Jim Lowell, the maker of Deso.bsp.

           About 1000 lines of Eliminator bot scripting alone (sheesh).
