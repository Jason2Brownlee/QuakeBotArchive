QUAKE Map E2M7 "The Underearth"
Modified by Reverend Ace Theta, Mid-February 1997
For use with Cameron Newham's ELIMINATOR Bot

ABOUT THIS .MAP :
This is my second finished Eliminator map for Quake (not counting an aborted
attempt to enable GIGGLER4.BSP), and probably the last.  Several modifications have been made to the level itself to make it more playable
with Eliminators (if you know the stock map like your own home, you'd better
read this):

1) Since the bots can't swim (see my notes in TH12_DM5.MAP), they won't 
travel from the area where the Quad Damage is (near the gold key door) 
through the tunnel, up from the water and out to beside the bridge outside 
the "front" door.  However, they CAN, and will, walk down the steps into the 
water and to the corner of the tunnel, where anyone under the bridge will be 
in their field of fire!

2) Since I didn't want the bots to be taking the time to throw switches that 
would only need to be thrown once, I didn't include switch presses.  Instead, 
I STRIPPED the map of all switches (as well as the barriers they triggered, 
of course).  The only exception is the Quad Damage secret (see #3 below), and 
the floor switch that triggers the giant post trap (the switch still 
functions and starts the trap, but the door is always open).

3) I was unable to open the QD secret by removing its reference in the .MAP, 
so instead I relocated the QD powerup nearby (the secret alcove still 
functions normally).  Also, the red armor now sits where one green armor used 
to, with the lightning gun behind the giant post trap.  This move was due to 
the fact that there is NO escape from the slime pit where the red armor was, 
since I have removed almost all switches (see #4 below)!

4) Frequent "No more free edicts" crashes while playtesting with several bots 
moved me to scour the .MAP for ALL non-essential entities.  This included 
monsters, monster paths, doors (see #2 above), and the biosuit and other 
items in one of the slime pits (see #3 above).  Don't be surprised to find 
some little oddities, such as the level exit doors being always wide open.  
SOME non-essential entities may still remain; as a computer programmer, I 
will always be an amateur.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
No "items" prioritizing was done on my waypoints; the bots seem able to 
identify a choice weapon or armor if it's in their sight, with or without 
setting the "items" flag.  This also helps them to be less predictable.  
They still have some trouble maneuvering around the two spike traps, and 
you'll frequently see them "squished" by the giant post trap if you spend 
some time around the red armor/lightning gun area in "observer" mode.

HOW TO USE THIS .MAP
Obtain a registered copy of Quake, the ELIMINATOR QuakeC patch, and QBSP.EXE.  Follow the instructions provided by Mr. Newham with his patch.  It IS a
hassle, but well worth it, as the ELIMINATOR is the best of the cbots I've 
been able to try.
