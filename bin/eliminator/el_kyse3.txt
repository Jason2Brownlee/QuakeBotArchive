Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

  This map simply allows you to use the Eliminator bots with kysenty3.map,
which is a remake of Doom2 map 1, but about a million times better!

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

Just put kysenty3.bsp into your eliminator/maps directory (or whatever you
call your eliminator dir.).  I'm sure you know how to run it if you have
the bots, but here's the startup command anyway:
  quake -game eliminator +map kysenty3


Technical Details
-----------------
- for level details, refer to kysenty3.txt
- I'm including the .bsp since this isn't an id level.

The bots are apparently "taller" than normal players, and can't walk around
the corners of the top catwalk in the ammo room (first room on the left, 
coming from the start position).  It would have probably been possible
to have them jump around the corners, but I didn't try it.  I had to move
some of the items on the top catwalk to the lower one so they wouldn't
be trying to get the ones on the top catwalk.  Also I didn't make them any
waypoints for the water, as it really doesn't lead anywhere except the exit.
It would have been cool though, but oh well. 


Copyright and Distribution Permissions
--------------------------------------
Refer to kysenty3.txt, it's Kayos's level.  I don't care what you do
with my mods to it.
