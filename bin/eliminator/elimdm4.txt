Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

This modification will add one more level to Cameron Newham's Eliminator Bot.
The level is DM4.

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

1.  If you don't have the Eliminator Bot, this mod will do nothing for you. :)
    You can get a version of the Eliminator Bot from:
      ftp.cdrom.com in the Quake C area under Bots\eliminator

2.  Unzip the archive into your elim\maps directory.  Run game using the +map
    dm4 parameter along with the others you use to run the eliminator bots.

Technical Details
-----------------
DM4      - Ack! I picked a terrible level for my first eliminator bot map :).
           The holes in the bottom walkway confuse the bots at times, and
           after a while so many backpacks of guns & ammo have fallen into the
           lava pit that they just can't help but jump in for them!, hehe
           Gameplay tends to congregate near the grenade launcher & bottom
           aisleway.  Overall it plays really good, but sometimes the bots
           don't die in the lava, so I find that I just have to start the
           map again after awhile.  Lots of action in the small level though.
           Have fun, if you can improve on it...please send me a copy & lemme
           know what you did to fix the probs I've mentioned above.
