        This is the latest version of ELIM 1.4.  I have placed this is a pak
file for those who are having trouble and for convience.  I have also included
Multiskin Pro with head gibs.  To install this, do the following:

1. Make directory in your quake directory called elim.

2. Unzip this files in there.

3. Then start game like so: quake -winmem 10 -game elim -listen
                            (-winmem 10 parameter only for win95 user)

4. Then bind keys to the following impulses:
        Impulse  166  -  Create a cbot (MAX of 10 cbots)
        Impulse  170  -  View gib scores
        Impulse  180  -  Observer mode

        Thats it.  This is the best bot to my opinion. So have fun. I did not
make this patch. I just helped by adding multiskin pro and making the pak file
for easier access.  The man who deserves all the credit is Cameron Newham.
Also the Multiskin Pro crew for making and organizing the great skins. Read
the other text files for more info on this patch. Have fun.
