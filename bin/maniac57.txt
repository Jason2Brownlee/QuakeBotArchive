                  Lives for only one thing,,,QUAKE / Q2
Pre-credit      : ID, in the old days there was doom, a good game and
                  i must admit i played loads of hours with it, created some
                  levels, and even got: ultimate doom and doom2.
                  i played (sorry id.) duke for some while and then duke atom
                  BUT THEN, i got my hands on quake, guess what i did to the
                  rest? (delete: doom1 doom1u doom2 duke dukeatomic)
                  all i needed was: Quake, and it still rocks any of the ones
                  above,,, THANX ID GAMES !!! 
                  Now for a long time allready quake2 is out.(i got it)
                  And there are rumors about quake 3 being created. KEWL!!
Comments        : Because there are so many weapons and other add-on's
                  from just about all the patches I got, it's obvious that
                  their bugs, maybe a few more, maybe a few less, are
                  also in this patch. (probably more, since some might
                  not be 100% compatible.(like the dartgun which is no longer
                  a part of this patch))
                : You MUST unzip this zipfile using the -d option!!!!
                : If there is anyone out there that wishes to join this team
                  (two man work at the moment) so: if u create good levels,
                  skins or u are a good programmer, or just plain good at art.
                  just send a mail.
                : To create a T-c i need a team, i was thinking of:
                  The secret of mana (a cool rpg for the snes)
                  Zombies, quake for undead only (maybe i'll do this for
                  quake2 only...
                  Some way of improving the hand to hand fighting in quake.
                  and the best: Quake Bomberman!!!! (with special level)
                  -Guess what? This tc is under construction right now....
                   Wanna help?
