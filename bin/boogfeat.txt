* Fixed offline player list (doesn't scroll off the screen now)

* Fixed aiming (kinda; it's at least 100% more accurate than before
anyway; it leads based on lag [the bot's], your victim's velocity, and your
velocity).  Anyway, it's sharp enough to beat most humans most of the time
:).

* "Fixed" targeting.  It now concentrates on a single target until
that target is either dead or not in the line of sight.  This breaks a lot
because I did it real sloppy.

* Bot just aims.  The only time the bot does anything is when you
push fire.  It then proceeds to find an enemy and lock on his expected
location.  It does actually turn you, partly because it's easier to
dodge/circle strafe that way, and partly to circumvent "Stooge detectors"
that kick you off if you maintain constant velocity while changing angles.

* Removed a bunch of code I didn't want.  (My intent was to make a
proxy-only bot, removing the autonomous code.  But I burnt out before doing
that.)
