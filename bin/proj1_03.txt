Okey. It's my QUAKE Project1 v0.2 - test version.
 Several QuakeC patches in one.

 What we have now?

 v0.1
     All powerups (except biosuit) we can switch ON/OFF by "impulse 133"
  (don't forget bind it to your favorite key).
     When powerup switched OFF - it's still with us until we not die and
  we can switch it ON at any time.
     When we get "QUAD damage" but holding it OFF - AXE has quad power.
     Backpacks can now exploding and explosing size/damage based on number
  of rockets in.
     YOUR backpack can now exploding - in case you have rockets in it -
  with probability 2%. Explosing size/damage based on number of rockets in
  your backpack.

 v0.2
     Probability of YOUR backpack exploding depending now from attacker weapon.
  (from 1.5% SuperNailGun, Lightning - to 5% SuperShotGun).
     When Quad damage turned OFF - no Quad sound.
     ShotGun powered up.
     SuperShotGun powered up, but reload time increased (DOOM style).
     Added reload SOUND (temporary it's ammo touch sound).
     Now we can see more blood.

 v0.3
     Added several new sounds and new sound events.
     Added SuperShotGun reload sound from DOOM II (C) IdSoftware.


 How to install it?
   Copy zip file to your Quake directory. Unzip with key "-d".
 Delete zip file and run "quake.exe -game project1".

 Where you can get source code? In final release I'll include it.

 Future plans:
 New "player_run" model based on health and ammo quantity;
 New weapon - BFG9000 model (I hope, I hope!);
 Deathmatch 3 by Avatar
 Teamplay -1
 Pipebombs and HoloQuaker (such in Duke3D).
 New additional sounds on many events.
 Rockets and grenades can path throuth teleports.
