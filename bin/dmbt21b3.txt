           legion@nether.net address is difficult for me to use since
           the nether.net system goes down from time to time.  To ensure
           that I receive your message please send the e-mail to
           legion@keg.zymurgy.org and *NOT* to legion@nether.net.

           legion@gaianet.net will no longer be working starting
           June 15th--the account will be deactivated.  My own connection
           to the internet is quite flaky (just like nether.net's) but
           even if I'm not connected, zymurgy.org will *STILL* receive
           your e-mail.  It just may take some time before I read them.
           I believe I lost some e-mail on my nether.net account since that
           system goes down for whatever reason.  The zymurgy account is
           more stable and reliable.

NOTE     : If you have v0.20b3, you can throw that away now.  Everything
           in that version (including any bugs) is also found in this
           version.  See "What's New" section for more details.

           Everyone who sent me comments via e-mail, you know who
           you are.  Yes, all four of you.  And, no, I didn't count
           my own e-mails to myself four times.

           All those people who made the skins in the player.mdl
           contained in DOOMBOT.ZIP that anyone who wishes to use
           this patch must download also.  I don't know who made
           them.  I took them from the 24Skinz patch and a few
           others I don't recall.

           Carson Sutton of Roambot.
           Jonathan E. Wright of Cujobot v1.4
           Alan Kivlin of QCBot for his detailed instructions on how
               to get the bots on the rankings and his accompanying
               source code to add bots to rankings
           Patrick Martin of Respawn v1.1 for the revive idea and his
               "template" even though I didn't use it.

Misc     : This is an Eliminatorbot/Roambot hybrid with added movement
           when attacking as well as additional search functions and
           attack functions not present in either of the original two
           bots.  Hope you like it.

           You'll need to download doombot.zip.  This contains the
           *.wav and *.mdl files not contained in this archive.  It
           also contains various text files, too.
           The file can be downloaded from

               ftp.cdrom.com/pub/quake/quakec/bots/doombot.zip

           To make this modification work, you will need to execute
           Quake by using the "-listen" parameter.  This is 
           performed by doing the following at the command prompt:

               a) quake -game doombot -listen 16

                           - or -

               b) q95 -game doombot -listen 16

           Notice the use of CAPS in the above examples.   "What caps?"
           you asked.  Figure it out.

Source Info
===========

I will not be releasing the source until I am finish fine-tuning the
essential elements of the package.  The final package may contain
bugs but it is hoped that the ESSENTIAL portions of the package
are bug free and therefore it is acceptable for distribution.  I
originally planned to release the source along with the legion of
doom modification but the progs.dat for this package alone is over
644k.  The progs.dat for the L.O.D. is over 1000k.  So right now,
it appears I won't be combining the L.O.D. and this modification
together.

Right now, the condition of the source code is pretty pathetic.  When
it is ready to be released, it will be just plain pathetic.

===============================
Description of the Modification
===============================

This modification creates one or more computer-controlled DEATHMATCH
opponents.  The purpose of this mod is to give deathmatch players
practice in defeating a competent opponent and/or give players a
chance to play a realistic deathmatch game WITHOUT the hassle of
lag or cheating from other human players.  The computer opponent is
often called a "bot", short for roBOT.  These are not like the monsters
in Quake, they are designed to mimic human players.

The bots *CAN* be used in cooperative games but a large lag will follow.
The reason is that the monsters now use the "monster_find_nearest_enemy"
function.  Why?  Because the original function, checkclient, only looks
for REAL players, one per frame, and not "faked" ones like the bots.
For you programmers, the classname for the doombot is "player" just like
real players.  In coop games, the monsters now look for every player
including bots as often as the original checkclient.  There is, however,
one exception.  Monsters will only look for bots every 0.12 seconds while
monsters will look for real players as often as it can, just if
checkclient was used.  So this means that in coop games, bots do have
an advantage over humans.  It has to be this way to reduce the lag as
much as possible.  Having 40+ monsters in the game is like having 40+
bots.  Trust me, it is a lot better this way.  Or I could just let the
monsters ignore the bots until the bots fire upon them.  The monsters
would notice the bot that shot them.  But that would be "unfair" to the
monsters.

Bots can not be used in single-player games.  The monsters use the
checkclient function in single-player games so single-player games with
this mod is no different from the original quake.

The bot is meant to be a DEATHMATCH opponent.  I added coop support to
allow users to see what the bots can do without worrying about being pounded
by them.

==============================
What's New v0.21b2 --> v0.21b3
==============================

   - I've changed the archive so that all the files you REALLY need
     is here.  Only the player.mdl is missing.  You'll need to
     download doombot.zip for that file.  Text files for the individual
     patches are also contained in doombot.zip so I suggest you get it.
   - ADDED CujoBot back in.  Here is the reason:
      - I was able to fix that crash problem whenever I spawned too
        many bots at once.
        - Cujo no longer eats gibs as a result
   - NO FREE EDICTS still occurs but at least not when spawning bots
      - with 15 bots, you should expect the game to crash with
        the no free edicts bogus bug error within 1 minute.
         - suggest 4 to 6 bots
         - with 15 bots, the game is pretty lagged anyway so why would
           you want 15 bots?
   

v0.21b1 --> v0.21b2 (unreleased)

   - REMOVED Cujobot, here are the reasons
      - increases likelyhood of NO FREE EDICTS crash greatly, it's
        actually okay, though, if you have only 2 or 3 bots MAX.  It's
        excellent if you have only one bot but how many of you will
        play a deathmatch game against only one bot or just two.
         - because CujoBot adds 11 new variables to EVERY entity
           in the game including the bots, spikes, etc.  This means that for
           every entity in the game, Quake has 11 additional variables
           it needs to keep track of.  One of the new variables
           happens to be an entity variable itself.
      - game crashes when Cujo attempts to eat gibs.  So I fixed it and
        a new problem occurs.  Game crashes when you spawn too many
        bots at the same time causing a lot of gibs.  You'll get a
        silly overflow error, and no it is NOT "packet overflow".  Now
        I know why ID had dead bodies execute the CopyToBodyQue function.
      - NO FREE EDICTS crashes now occur after only spawning 5 bots
        quickly while in COOP mode.


v0.20b3 --> v0.21b1 (unreleased)

   - the addition of two new patches was MUCH easier than expected so
     release date is pretty close to original plans
   - added P. Manole's grappling hook v2.2 patch
      - patch has been modified so that one impulse toggles
        on/off the grappling hook.  Use impulse 73 to toggle hook.
      - hook is *NOT* a weapon.  It can only be activated using an
        impulse.  So you can simultaneously fire your current weapon
        AND the hook if you want.  If you kill a player with the hook,
        the obituary will credit the kill to the weapon you currently
        selected.  That is, "Bonehead ate two buckshots..." instead of
        "Bonehead was ripped apart by Loser's hook".
      - those of you already experienced in using the hook, keep in mind
        that the bots from the beginning do *NOT* go through pain frames
        very often except when it is close to dying.  I mentioned this
        so that you won't think that the game is made much easier by
        adding this patch.
      - patch has been modified so that you won't hook your opponent
        "forever".  A maximum of 15 consecutive hits are allowed before
        the hook disables itself.  Each hit after the initial hit does
        3 points of damage.  The first hit does 10 points of damage.
      - deathmatch 32 to disable grappling hooks

   - added J. Wright's Cujo bot v1.4 patch
      - not tested at all in single-player games or coop games
      - deathmatch 256 to enable Cujo bot
      - Cujo bot is obtained by picking up lowest ranking armor in level
      - those who defend "the armor" probably will do well in these games
      - if you use this on a server, a REAL player must log in to make
        Cujo available in deathmatch 256 games.

   - if you use this patch on a server, the clients would need to
     download DOOMBOT.ZIP and DMBT21B1.ZIP from ftp.cdrom.com or get
     these files from you.
                              


v0.20b2 --> v0.20b3

   - better looking text file
   - added coop support
      - monsters can now "see" the bots
      - bots can now "see" the monsters
   - bot recognizes buttons now and can press them if they choose to
      - previously, it presses buttons by "accident".
   - bot moves around more randomly now
   - the amount of time bot searches for an item has been reduced
      - time is no longer hard-coded, it is now based on distance
        from bot when it initially found it.  Minumum search time,
        however, is five seconds.
         - this ALSO means that items will be tagged unreachable after
           five seconds of trying to get to it.  Will be tagged
           reachable after 90 seconds.  This means it can try again
           later.
   - bot will now still search for enemies while moving to found
     items.
   - code that was commented out in previous version(s) have been
     uncommented out (hopefully, I found them all)
      - eg. players can no longer use the "impulse 9" cheat code
        in deathmatch and coop games anymore
   - bot recognizes doors now.  Previously, it uses doors by "accident".
     Now bot can CHOOSE to head towards a door.
   - bot recognizes doors that need to be shot to open.
   - increased "miss factor" for bots by over 50% for all skill levels
   - yaw speed (how fast bot can turn) is now based on skill level
      - this affects bots ability to follow target greatly
      - can also affect bots ability to aim at target
         - try circling a skill 0 bot, then try doing the same
           thing against a skill 3 bot.
      - low skill bots can sometime move like a "truck" making wide turns
      - combined with the increased "miss factor" above, the low skill
        bots are a "non-aiming" bunch assuming you are not stationary.
   - will NOT shoot trigger_multiple entities.  Actually it never did.
     Until I can find a way to keep the bot from shooting at it over and
     over again, this ability won't be added.
   - removed "server-friendly" status.  so now everyone who wishes to
     use this modification will now have to download DOOMBOT.ZIP
   - 6 new names were added so a total of 15 bots can be spawned

   - this beta version still needs to be tested.

===============
Future versions
===============

   - may add female skins and sounds like the Darkbot v0.10.
      - need to know where I can get female skins and sounds
   - looking for suggestions for WEAPONS you want the bot to use
      - weapon must not use a lot of explosions in a short period of time
         - this causes lag
            - those with high resolution suffer from the lag the most
      - information on where I can download the source for this weapon
      - must not be of the "super" weapon type.  See Killer Quake Patch
        for numerous examples.  Imagine what a bot could do with these
        and you can see why I won't add "super" weapons.
      - must be a WEAPON, not a gadget like decoys, holograms and such
         - bots don't need gadgets
         - bots don't get fooled by gadgets
         - I don't like gadgets.  They are boring.
   - add more comments
      - looking for suggestions for comments the bots would say

================
General Comments
================

   - I have a strong suspicion that bots won't show up on rankings properly,
     if at all, if this patch is used on a server.  Since I have only one
     computer to play Quake, I can not test its limited server capabilities.
      - if bots don't show up on rankings, then I will probably add the
        old method of keeping track of frag counts

   - This version [0.21b1] still needs extensive testing.  The hook and Cujo
     were added without any extensive testing of v0.20b3.  If anyone
     sent bug reports via e-mail, I have not read them yet since I
     am unable to log in to my nether.net account.  And obviously, I can not
     send out any e-mail, either.  In any case, please send bug reports
     to legion@keg.zymurgy.org instead of legion@nether.net.

     I've always had the zymurgy account but it requires a mail client that
     supports POP3.  I've only recently found one that works in
     Linux that works well--Netscape's.

     (If you are still confused, nether.net is *NOT* my ISP.  Nether.net
     is the system I use to read/send e-mail.)

   - Curious as to why Jonathan E. Wright, author of both Cujobot AND
     Zeus bot, has never gotten around to combining the two patches.
     As of this writing, only Killer Quake patch v2.0 by Howard Roy has
     both of these bots together.   Pretty cool compilation patch.
     Download it from ftp.cdrom.com/pub/quake as soon as you can.
      - although I did find the gibbable bodies of the KQP to be so
        damn annoying.

================
Doombot Features
================

   - varying skill levels from zero to three
   - bots can camp but only on modified, waypoint maps
   - search routine is prioritized:
      - searches for enemies first
      - searches for items second
      - searches for shootable doors, buttons to push, etc. last
   - bots can run, jump and swim like real players
      - bot won't blindly go up for air when it is swimming.
        it will only go up if there is room to go up
   - bots can pick up all items that a real player can
   - bots use waypoints to move around just like the eliminatorbot
      - waypoints are found on MODIFIED maps.
         - two modified maps for START and DM6 are included
            in doombot.zip
         - you can get more modified maps at
            ftp.cdrom.com/pub/quake/quakec/bots/eliminator
      - if no waypoints are found, bot will move around randomly like
        the roambot
         - this means if you choose to play the bot on UNMODIFIED
           maps, the bot will move around randomly hitting walls,
           walking through doors, pressing buttons, picking up items,
           going through teleporters as it searches for your dumb ass.
   - bots show up on rankings and have their own colors and names
      - this is the reason for executing Quake using the -listen
        parameter discussed above.  Otherwise, it will crash.
      - if you wish to practice loading up Quake, I suggest you
        try to spawn 4 or more bots without using the -listen
        parameter.
      - this is also the reason for not using the bots in single-player
        games.  You don't have "rankings" in single-player games.  Spawning
        one bot in single-player games causes an "i > max.clients" crash
        which I am sure some of you already found out the hard-way.
   - upto 15 bots can be spawned but I recommend 4 to 6 for P100 machines
   - bots will chase target while attacking
      - not like the Zeus bot when it chooses to fight from a distance, Zeus
        will only "chase" if you are too far away.  Doombot always chases.
   - bot can use *ALL* eight weapons.
      - chooses the axe when appropriate
         - unlike other bots which don't use the axe or it only
           uses the axe when it runs out of ammo, doombot will consider
           the axe as a VIABLE option
   - bot will chase you around when it is attacking you.
   - bot can also "revive" rather than respawn after being killed
   - the bot named Jason is the only one, player or bot, that can use
     the throwing axe
   - when bot is chasing player, bot will strafe left and right if player
     is looking at the bot.  Otherwise, it will not strafe.
   - when bot is close enough to player, bot will attempt to circle enemy
     for skill levels greater than 2.
   - when chasing player, bot will not follow the player into lava most of
     the time.  Will still follow player into water or slime.
   - low skill bots are "nervous".  Don't be surprise to see some eratic
     shooting from these bots unless it has a shotgun.  Something called
     bullet spread helps reduce the chance that the bot will miss from
     close range even if you are moving.
   - bots use skins, players do not.
   - navigates over "cracked ground" (eg. the rocket launcher corridor of
     the START map) when chasing player, roaming around randomly or picking
     up items on maps without waypoints
      - bot uses my own bot_movetogoal function to move around for these
        things
      - bot uses Quake's movetogoal function to move around when it is
        using waypoints.  So it is not smooth on cracked ground on these
        maps.
         - eliminator waypoint routine contains instructions for jumps and
           swimming.  bot_movetogoal has its own routine for jumps and
           swimming.  Thus, waypoint routine not fully compatible with
           bot_movetogoal.
   - when the bot loses a player it was chasing, there's a 3-4 second
     delay before the bot starts looking for OTHER enemies.  It will only
     look for that one specific enemy for 3 to 4 seconds.  This gives other
     players 3 to 4 seconds to fire the first shot.  Don't blow it.

   - no more weapon switching when picking up backpacks.
   - backpacks now contain *ALL* the weapons the previous owner had

   - THIS IS A DEATHMATCH BOT!

===============
Doombot Options
===============

   - deathmatch 16 puts health in backpacks
      - pickup backpacks and you get health.
         - amount of health is depended on skill level of previous
           owner
         - human owners give random amount of health
   - deathmatch 32 to DISABLE grappling hooks.
   - deathmatch 64 for "Humans vs Bots" deathmatch games.
      - humans can do whatever but bots will only attack humans
      - bots have the same skin and color
   - deathmatch 128 for Axe-Only deathmatch games.
   - deathmatch 256 to ENABLE cujobot

===================
Server Instructions
===================

   a) set temp1 variable in autoexec.cfg to 100
      (eg. temp1 100).
      - this spawns bots automatically once a REAL player logs in
   b) set sv_aim in autoexec.cfg.  Follow instructions in autoexec.cfg.
      - sv_aim controls how many bots and skill level
   c) set deathmatch variable in autoexec.cfg for variation. Default = 1.
   d) load Quake:
      quake -game doombot -dedicated +map (mapname)

   - Alternatively,
   a) load Quake:
      quake -game doombot -listen 16 +map (mapname)
   b) join game as a player on server
   c) press F7 (assuming you executed autoexec.cfg that came with the patch).
      - this will execute bot.cfg to create bots based on your specifications
        in bot.cfg

   - or alternatively (recommended)
   a) set temp1 variable in autoexec.cfg to 100 (eg. temp1 100).
      - this is to spawn bots automatically
   b) set sv_aim in autoexec.cfg.  Follow instructions in autoexec.cfg.
      - sv_aim controls how many bots and skill level
   c) set deathmatch variable in autoexec.cfg for variation. Default = 1.
   d) load Quake:
      quake -game doombot -listen 16 +map (mapname)
   e) join game as a player. bots will then spawn automatically.      


   NOTE: the clients NEED to download DOOMBOT.ZIP and DMBT21B1.ZIP.


=====================
Extraction Directions
=====================

   With DOOMBOT.ZIP

   a) create the following directories within Quake main directory
      doombot
      doombot\maps
      doombot\progs
      doombot\sound\axe
      doombot\text
   b) extract all *.bsp files into the doombot\maps directory
   c) extract all *.mdl files into doombot\progs
   d) extract all *.wav files into doombot\sound\axe
   e) extract all *.txt files into doombot\text
   f) extract progs.dat into doombot
   g) execute quake by
      quake -game doombot -listen 16

   With dmbt21b1.zip

   a) copy progs.dat into doombot directory
      - this will overwrite the older progs.dat in doombot.zip
   b) execute quake by
      quake -game doombot -listen 16


================
Impulse Commands
================   

   a) impulse 73 toggles on/off the grappling hook      
   b) impulse 200 spawns one DEATHMATCH bot.

   - NO FREE EDICTS.  This is due to a MAJOR, MAJOR problem with Quake
   and has absolutely NOTHING to do with the patch itself.  This error
   occurs for a couple of reasons.
      1) Quake is grossly incapable of keeping count with the number
         of free edicts available.  That is, rather than use an edict
         that has been designated as free (which means that Quake
         should use that edict!), Quake creates more edicts.  There is
         a maximum number of edicts that can be created.   Once this
         maximum number has been exceeded, Quake will crash.  You will
         see this error quite often in patches and maps which causes
         Quake to spawn a lot of entites quickly.
      2) The maximum number of edicts is only 449.  All entities uses
         edicts.  So those spike traps that you are so fond of eats up
         a few edicts.  Those lava balls that you see uses up edicts.
         The bubbles you see when you are drowning uses edicts.  Players
         getting gibbed uses edicts.  The list goes on and on.  Naturally,
         it should not surprise anyone that the maximum limit is reached
         so quickly especially since Quake is incapable of keeping track of
         the actual number in use.

      - to reduce the likelyhood that this error would occur, you
        should do one or more of the following:
         a) use a BETTER map.
            - smaller map
            - map with few spike traps, lava balls, etc.
            - maps with waypoints but not too many waypoints
         b) use fewer bots (prefered range is 4 to 6 bots)
         c) use a higher skill level (preferred range is 2.5 to 2.8)
            - skill 3 bots are a tiny bit "unrealistic" in its use of
            the grenade launcher.
            - low skill bots spawn markers to roam around randomly
               - lower the skill, more often it roams randomly
               - higher the skill, more often it uses waypoints on
                 maps that have them
               - more markers spawned means greater chance of crash
            - *ALL* bots regardless of skill will roam randomly
              on maps without waypoints.  This means they will be spawning
              markers.  This is why I recommend waypoint maps.
         d) don't try to spawn too many bots at once.
            - prior to adding the hook and Cujo, you could spawn bots
              (upto 15) very quickly and without any problems.  This
              is not true anymore.  Even with the grappling hook and
              Cujo disabled, the problem still persists.
              - the extra patches require more variables for Quake to
                keep track of.  It doesn't matter if the hook and Cujo
                is disabled.  The patches are part of the doombot now
                and so are all the variables used by these patches.
                Thus, Quake now has a harder time keeping track of the
                number of edicts in use.


   - PLAYER ends up in a VOID.  If you see a gray-colored area in your
     screen then you are in a void.  This is again a problem with Quake.
     Quake has a problem in removing entities properly.  In using the hook,
     the hook itself needs to be removed, right?  When a victim dies and
     the hook is removed, occasionally Quake transports the victim into a
     void after Quake removes the hook.  This happens with ANY entity is
     removed and the "victim" happens to be at the same location as the
     entity.   Don't be surprise to see a few bots disappearing after
     30 minutes of play.  The only solution to this ignorant problem is
     to make sure that no entites are removed EXCEPT when its "think time"
     is up.  This is unacceptable as this will not work at all with the
     hook and increases the likelyhood that NO FREE EDICTS error will occur.
      - this won't mess up the entire game, only the "victim" is affected.
        If the victim is a real player, the player will have to re-enter
        the game and start from the beginning.  If the victim is a bot,
        then that bot is gone for good.  The "think" functions of the
        bot is disabled while it is in a void.  And there are two types
        of voids you should be aware of.
         - one void is where you keep falling and falling and falling.
           - I've included a routine in all of the think functions to
             check for this.  If the bot has "fallen" from the level,
             the bot will explode and respawn at a player DM start.
         - another void is the first void I described in which all you
           see is a grey area in your screen.  The think functions are
           disabled and the bots are stuck.  In fact, if you are in this
           void you are stuck too and that is why you have to start over.
      - some of you probably have seen this void problem in other people's
        weapon patches.  Some authors have commented that maybe their new
        weapon was just too powerful.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.
      - bug does not occur very often and I've only seen it twice and both
        times involved being hooked and killed with a rocket launcher or
        grenade launcher.   Deathmatch 32 disables hook.

   - INCORRECT frame usage.  Actually, this is an old bug I haven't got a
     clue on how to fix it.  The bot will go through incorrect frames.  It
     does not affect game play--bot can still run, swim, jump, attack,
     search for items or enemies and other things.  It looks strange seeing
     the bot go through a portion of the death animation while still
     trying to kill you.  It is believed that this is a problem with
     Quake.  Quake has a bad problem in "remembering" the values of various
     variables.  Incorrect frame usage could be one of the symptoms of this
     problem.  For all I know, Quake's inability to keep track of free
     edicts could be related to this.  That is, that problem is also a
     symptom of another problem--Quake can not keep track of variables fast
     enough and accurate enough.
      - the animation sequence does get corrected eventually however.  And
        the problem does not occur too often but it occurs often enough to
        deserve mentioning.
