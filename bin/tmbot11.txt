Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
Updated version of TM Bot (v. 1.0).
See technical details for new stuff.

Automated Helper Bot or Player 2 on only one computer!
With this advanced AI you can conquer any level of Quake.
TM Bot is based on the Enforcer Model.
Just activate the bot and he'll be completely automated.


How to use Modification
-------------------------------
Impulse 100		Activates and Deactivates the Bot

Impulse 101		Toggles Automatic/Manual Control Modes

Impulse 102		Auto: Fires Weapon
			Manual: Toggles bot Stop/Walk/Run

Impulse 103		Auto: Toggle bot's auto-fire
			Manual: Turn left

Impulse 104		Auto: Teleport bot to player
			Manual: Turn right

Impulse 105		Toggle Co-op/Deathmatch modes

Works great with the gravis gamepad:

		2
	      1   4
		3

Button 2 would fire / move
Button 1 would toggle auto fire / turn left
Button 4 would teleport / turn right
Button 3 would toggle auto mode / manual mode

And you could assign bot activate/deactivate &
DM toggle to keyboard keys. 


How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
	Make a directory called TMBOT off of your quake directory.
Unzip the archive into the TMBOT directory. Now run quake, adding
"-game tmbot" to the command line (do not type the quotes). Bind
the impulses and you're ready to go.

	If you would like to see the source code, modify it, or
recompile it, we have included it in the source.zip file. All
modifications to original source have been marked with "TM Bot".


Technical Details
-----------------
Fixes for version 1.1:

Bit flags - Replaced five floats with one float and many bit flags.

DM toggle - Toggles between Co-op and Deathmatch modes.
            (a lot of people requested this one.)

Speed - Increased walk speeds for the bot.

*Safety - Working on decreased incidents of friendly fire.
          (Thanks to Anthony Elk for reporting this.)

Solidity - Bot is now solid to its owner.

*Controls - Working on fix so pain and death are not interrupted.

Spawning - Starts and teleports home at an offset position.
         - Orientation of bot is now always level. (Thanks to
           Anders Dalvander for reporting this.)

*Firing - Working on manual firing control in manual mode.
        - Manual firing while in auto mode causes bot to
          face towards it enemy. (Thanks to Anders Dalvander
          for reporting this.)

* Not fixed in 1.1, so we plan on releasing a version 1.2.
