Version		: 32

Email		: rj45@mail.com

This mod is based on official 1.01 frogbot clan arena release by ParboiL (source code here: http://www.parboil.quakeworld.ru/parboil/src101.zip)

The main concept behind this modification is bring the better gameplay with frogbots and more humanlike behaviour (including speedjumping, tricks on various supported maps, better strafing in combat and avoiding missiles, less predictability,.. and so on). Note the speedjumping is far from ideal at this moment, but we working on it to make it better.

Important Notes
===============
- You should have wordwrap enabled in your text editor to view this file.
- Refer to beginners.txt and fbca101kt_eng.txt (or fbca101kt_rus.txt if you russian) for more information on the Frogbot.
- Config included is /configs folder. Executing one of the config is an easy way to enable Clan Arena, damage frags, and rocket-jumping bots. Also, this sets sv_gamedir to "arena", so QuakeWorld clients won't have to download sounds if they already have them in their arena folder.
- You can only toggle chasecam during a match and if you are not playing. Attack toggles it on/off. When in chase mode, jump switches to the next client.
- You can use the reset command instead of reloading the map to change settings such as 'deathmatch' and 'arena'.
-Type 'rules' when connected to server to see list of available commands
