	C:>QUAKE>quake -game qcbot

  Hey, it works ! Fantastic !!!

NEW IN THIS VERSION
-------------------

	* some bug fixed (yeeeehaaaa !) like angles...
	* Listen : all the teamplay modes works prefectly !!! (execpt the red bots in 
	  teamplay 1)
	* Teamplay 1, Teamplay 2, Deathmatch 1 modes !!! Try them all !
	* Modified the message at startup. You can see what mode is in use too ! very cool
	* friend bots folow you until they acquire a target.
		

LAST VERSION
------------
	
	* do you know what ? The bots start being intelligent ! When they jump, because now 
	they jump, they check before if there's lava or slime ! Cool, isn't it ?
	* added a lot of code for WATER STATE of the bots (water, lava, and slime). Now, the
	bots go inside water, and after 12 s, they start drowning, and maybe dead ! All 
	of this with total player sound !
	* when the bots talk, there's a beep, like when real players talk.
	* when a bot is in water, and if his current weapon is the lightning, he think to
	kill you in a giga discharge, or select another weapon, like the rocket launcher.
	* when you do the weapons cheat (impulse 9), you substract to you 3 frags
	* Added MOTDD, at start
	* players get a new weapon : the Flamed Rocket Launcher (select the 
	Rocket Laucher Twice)
	* substract the laser to the bots, because it slowed down the game
	* reduce num of the weapons for the bots when they respawn or start the game,
	because it slowed down the game, and it was too dificult to kill them !
	* add a beta version of a new MG Point defense ! This missile stick into the wall
	and start to shoot after an enemy in a short radius.
	* tryed to make the bots flamethrower better !!!
	* the bots can jump randomely, so they can go on all the map, and they're not 
	  stopped on the platforms ! cool !!
	* a new mode : show name mode. See the name of your enemy (in front of you)
	* The bots fire flamethrower
	* Also Laser too
	* players have an homing nailgun ! Cool !!
	* Also bots have an homing nailgun... Shit !
	* players get a chaingun weapon : select the super nailgun 
	  (WARNING : It make sometimes crash the game)
	* the Grappeling Hook is here ! This will make players happy !
	  Select twice the axe.
	* the bots don't shoot at you when they don't see you ! They hunt you instead !!
	  He he !!
	* fixed some bugs on the bot flamethrower shoot, and bot movements
	* players are alowed to use the flamethrower (select super shotgun twice)
	* bots move faster
	* some cheat codes for the cheaters... (for bad players !)  :)
	* fixed the bug of the grapple sound (it was "blob/land.wav not precached")

FUTUR VERSION
-------------

	I Think to work on the teamplay bots. There's too much bugs when running
	this mode, so... With a strong teamplay mode, this bots will be nearly
	perfect...
	I'll try to make the bots swimming up when they start to drown.
	For the version 1.01 of this bots, the total version, and not the beta, all
	bugs (I hope), will be fixed, and the bots will be able to fire hook (grappler)
	too.
