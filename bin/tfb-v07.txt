           TFBOTS v0.7 for TeamFortress v2.5
=------------------------------------------------------=
Important Information
---------------------

    Please note this is a early beta.  The features are not all done, there
are still lots of bugs.  Sometimes it crashes for a multiple of different
reasons.  Currently it isn't GLQuake or QuakeWorld friendly.  There will
probably be almost constant revisions.  If you want a version with text
files and support for almost all the levels, check back in a few weeks.
The bots are still quite unoptimized.  Currently compiled for a roughly
P120/P133, they can be optimized to run better on slower computers by re-
compiling (see source code section) against the trade off they take longer
to find their way around levels.

There is little point e-mail me with a message like "its shit".  If you
think you can help, then help me with the bots.  If not, wait for
someone else to code a bot.  I'm not forcing you to download this!

To the TF Communitee
--------------------

I'm depending on the TF communitee to help me with this bot.  For
instance to get the waypoints for the other maps done, and to help
me get working GLQuake and QW versions.

Source Code
-----------

I have included the source code with the bot and all utils needed to compile
it.  I've done this because many of the bots features can and have to be set
at compile time.  For fast computers, the bots can be optimized to run better.
The settings can also be fiddled with played with(ie how long the bots keep
their order etc etc).  If you do find any better settings than the default,
please e-mail then to me.  Simply edit the options.qc file(bot options
are at the end) and re-compile using make.bat.
    I don't want people releasing alternate version of this.  If you do have
any contribution/fixes please send them to me.  You are of course free to
release a new version of the bots under a totally different
name as long as you give me the credit for the old version.<br>
At least ask my permission before you use a large amount of my source code
for anything else(ie the shortest route code).  Please remember you also
have the TF source code permissions to think about.

Phew.  Now play against the bots!  8-)


Installation
------------

Simply copy the progs.dat to the team-fortress directory
(Remember to make a copy of the progs.dat first)

Run like this:
    quake -game fortress -listen 16 bla bla bla...

Bots count as clients so remember to leave space for them in
the listen parm.  Also, everyone should connect before the bots are spawned.
Ignore all mentions of "Tried to sprint to non-client".  Its a bug which
I haven't be able to remove, but doesn't affect gameplay too bad.

Please bug me with any beta reports or suggestions(sensible please!)
at wolfg_l@pro-net.co.uk

Remember bots can do their own order(default).

Impulses:
    Rec key Command         Does
    enter   "impulse 186"   Brings up a menu to select what class bot
                            to spawn.  See below
    '       "impulse 187"   Cycles between teams.  Next spawned bot will
                            be on whatever team it is on.
    n       "impulse 190"   Tell local bot to roam + think for itself
    m       "impulse 191"   Tell local bot to escort you
    ,       "impulse 192"   Tell local bot to camp at your location
    .       "impulse 193"   Tell local bot to attack
    /       "impulse 194"   Tell local bot to defend
            "impulse 195"   Tell local bot to snipe - Hmmmmm(only self-order)

These are set in the included bot.cfg
