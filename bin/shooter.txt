This mod will create a helper bot called Demonshooter. This guy will HELP you 
in SINGLEPLAYER mode to defeat the monsters of Shub-Niggurath or in MULTI-
PLAYER mode to kill other players and bots. He will just HELP you and NOT 
do everything you want. If you protect him he will protect you and every-
thing will be fine.

Demonshooter will kill your enemies. If he gets injured, and he has not enough 
armor or shells he will pick up items, to recover. In case you also 
need them you better pick them up before he does. He will not follow
you into water, slime or other wet things. But I think in my next version
he will. He only uses a shotgun and will not pick up other weapons or ammo
for another weapon. If you've called him once he will always respawn again when you 
enter the next Level. It is not possible to get him away. You have to kill
him if you get rid of him. You can call him only ONE time. If he dies,
you cannot call him again before you start a new game or repeat the level
he died in! That's the way life is...

This is the first version of Demonshooter - and - the first thing I created
in QuakeC. Demonshooter will not hesistate to shoot you, if you're 
between him and an enemy. Up to now, I don't know any other bugs, but if you 
find one - or more than one - please email me at Shootermaster@HoTMaiL.com and explain 
what kind of problem you have experienced. I also welcome suggestions for the next version 
of Demonshooter. 


To install this mod, you have to create a new directory in your Quake folder.
For example "Shooter". Unzip the pak0.pak file into this new directory. 
Start Quake by typing:

         QUAKE -game new_directory

new_directory has to be replaced by the name of your new folder. You can call Demonshooter
by typing:
  
         impulse 100

at the console or by writing:

         bind o "impulse 100"

into your personal config.cfg file. In this case you call Demonshooter every 
time you press "o". If you want another character for calling Demonshooter 
replace o by the character you want to call him with. Have fun!!! 
For this reason I created him.

You may edit the source code or use it as a basis for other modifications as 
long as line 323 of the original shootai.qc file remains unchanged. If you write 
a completely new code and write parts of the Demonshooter code into it you have
to insert line 323 of the original shootai.qc file into the same context of your
new code. Apart of that you can do with the code what you want to.
