Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

MultiWeapon allows players to see each others weapons in deathmatch or
cooperative play. Forget about the standard "blaster" you're used to seeing.
With MultiWeapon, someone with a rocket launcher has a rocket launcher, and
someone with a single shotgun has a single shotgun.


Installation
-----------

To install, copy multiwep.zip to your Quake directory. From that directory,
run the command "pkunzip -d multiwep" This will create a directory called
"multiwep" and will place all necessary files there. (Obviously you need
pkunzip first.) Then run Quake with the command "quake -game multiwep".

This version includes a modified version of YCam by Harvey Lee (see credits).
IMPULSE 15 toggles a chase camera. I have included this primarily so that you
can see the effect without having to connect to a server running the patch.
However, this patch also makes a nice addition to chase cameras like YCam because
now you can see your own weapon even though the viewmodel is turned off.

How I made this patch
-----------------------

The weapons are based on the g_*.mdl models. The new single shotgun model is
based on the double shotgun. I removed a barrel, rearranged the parts, reshaped
and rotated the "pump" object, and created a new section of skin. I have tried
to mimic the look of v_shot.mdl from the player perspective.

All the g_*.mdl weapon models used shirt and pant colors, so I used Paint Shop
Pro to remedy this before I imported them into the player model. PSP lets you
load and save palettes, so all I did was save a standard Quake palette file and
one modified to have no "unsafe" colors. Then, I loaded the skin, loaded the
"safe" palette, loaded the standard Quake palette, saved, and imported the new
skin back into the model. Withought following this procedure, seemingly random
pixels in the weapon take on the current shirt and pant colors.

The g_*.mdl models were not designed with player.mdl in mind, so there are
frames where the weapon may slightly intersect with the player. This should
be barely noticable during normal gameplay, and is certainly no more objectionable
than the contortions some of the standard id monster models go through.

The source code is in a directory called QC under the MultiWep directory. I hope
this patch will be integrated with other popular patches, as it really is an
enhancement to existing Quake and not an augmentation with new weapons or items. It
should be very easy to merge, as there are only a few places the original Quake
files need to be changed.
