DoomBot v0.20b2 by Roscoe A. Sincero (legion@nether.net)

   for the Legion of Doom patch.

DoomBot is an eliminatorbot/roambot hybrid.

FILENAME: dmbt20b2.zip 

Next version: v0.21.  I had planned to release it June 13th but it will
              be delayed.  I'd originally planned to add the Cujobot in
              this next version but I decided that I'd add the grappling
              hook instead.  I just downloaded the source for hook23.
              I'm planning to work on it next week.

              [Prediction: Chicago Bulls vs. Utah Jazz, Chicago 4-2]


Things you need: You'll need to download DOOMBOT.ZIP.  That is the
                 original release version that contains all the
                 modified maps, mdls, sounds, and text files.  This
                 file only contains an updated progs.dat to make
                 it easy to upgrade.  If you don't have doombot.zip,
                 I suggest you download it if you wish to play the
                 bot properly.  You CAN play the bots on non-modified
                 maps such as the original ID's deathmatch maps but
                 it plays better on modified maps.  This means that
                 you do not need the modified maps to play the bots.


                 If you wish to play the bots with other modified
                 maps, use the maps for the eliminatorbot.  You can
                 get more maps from
                     ftp.cdrom.com/pub/quake/quakec/bots/eliminator/

Changes from v0.20b1 --> v0.20b2
   * invisibility "stuffcmd" bug fixed. So game should not
     crash on DM6 anymore.
   * modified supernailgun has been modified again to
     reduce lag (ie. no more explosions) for those of
     you with high-resolution.  Weapon uses same amount
     of ammo as the original supernail gun but it is a little 
     more powerful (25 points vs. 18).  My original
     modification had the supernailgun using the same
     amount of ammo as the nailgun but it is less
     powerful than the original SNG (15 vs 18).  However,
     it had explosions which I liked.  Unfortunately,
     these explosions are responsible for the lag.
   * I toned down the momentum by 50% for being hit by opponent's
     weapon.  I increased it too much the first time.
   * tweaked bot_movetogoal function.  This function is
     now used in all ai_functions with one exception,
     ai_run for eliminatorbot-type roaming of map.
     bot_movetogoal function is used in chasing player,
     random roaming of map (for levels without waypoints),
     and while moving towards items.  Originally,
     bot_movetogoal is used only in attacking.  Quake's
     own movetogoal was used in everything else.
     bot_movetogoal is not compatible with ai_run for the
     simple reason that bot_movetogoal includes the jumpai.
     ai_run has its own jumpai which obtains its direction
     for jump from waypoints.  Thus, can't use
     bot_movetogoal in ai_run.  Other than the conflicting
     jump code, bot_movetogoal works okay.  If you are
     curious, bot_movetogoal also includes the swimai.
   * tweaked jumpai a little but still ain't perfect.
   * tweaked swimcode so that bot will no longer blindly
     decide to go up for air when the time limit is up.
     That is, it will only go up if there is room to
     move up.
   * to encourage operators to set this up on a server,
     I've changed the throwaxe.mdl to a lavaball and removed
     all the new sounds from the source.  Therefore, this
     version is server-friendly. This is just for testing
     purposes to let as many people use it as possible.
     Final release will have everything in place.  I don't
     have a server, so I never tried it out on a server.
     I have only one computer to play Quake on.  So I have
     no idea if this patch will work on a server.

   * added humans vs bots "deathmatch".  Bots won't hunt other
     bots, only humans.  Humans can do whatever they want.
     Deathmatch 64 specifies "Humans vs. Bots".  Bots do not
     use skins in these games.  They are always BLUE.  Make sure
     you specify deathmatch settings PRIOR to loading any levels.

*NEW* server instructions.

   a) set temp1 variable in autoexec.cfg to 100
      (eg. temp1 100).
      - this spawns bots automatically once a REAL player logs in
   b) set sv_aim in autoexec.cfg.  Follow instructions in autoexec.cfg.
      - sv_aim controls how many bots and skill level
   c) set deathmatch variable in autoexec.cfg for variation. Default = 1.
   d) load Quake:
      quake -game doombot -dedicated +map (mapname)

   - Alternatively,
   a) load Quake:
      quake -game doombot -listen 16 +map (mapname)
   b) join game as a player on server
   c) press F7 (assuming you executed autoexec.cfg that came with the patch).
      - this will execute bot.cfg to create bots based on your specifications
        in bot.cfg

   - or alternatively (recommended)
   a) set temp1 variable in autoexec.cfg to 100 (eg. temp1 100).
      - this is to spawn bots automatically
   b) set sv_aim in autoexec.cfg.  Follow instructions in autoexec.cfg.
      - sv_aim controls how many bots and skill level
   c) set deathmatch variable in autoexec.cfg for variation. Default = 1.
   d) load Quake:
      quake -game doombot -listen 16 +map (mapname)
   e) join game as a player. bots will then spawn automatically.      

NOTE: Only the SERVER needs the modified maps.  The clients do not
      need the modified maps.  The original will do.

*known bugs*
   * bot will face in very odd directions.  Can affect game
     play.  Haven't found a "workaround" for the stupid
     Quake "world" bug.  Quake (sometimes called "Quake
     engine") resets the goalentity to world causing the bot
     to face in odd directions.  You can *NOT* modify the
     Quake engine with QuakeC but I'm trying to find something
     that can counteract this ignorant Quake bug.  Quake
     has a nasty habit of "forgetting" the values of various
     variables/entites and then remembering it.  Forgetting
     the coordinates of "goalentity" (the target the bot is
     heading to) is a big NO-NO.  This severely hampers the
     bots ability to hunt down its target once it loses sight
     of target.  Besides facing odd directions, the other
     side-effect of the world bug is that the bot will head
     towards crazy directions as if it was "lost". If you are
     getting your butt kicked, you'd probably not notice this
     bug.  But I know it is there. If you know of a way to
     counteract this ignorant Quake bug, please send me e-mail
     to legion@nether.net, legion@gaianet.net and
     legion@the-hermes.net.

     (Note: the-hermes.net e-mail account will be active for
     at least 3 months starting June 3rd, 1997.)


Things you should know:

   a) After all the bugs have been ironed out, this bot WILL
      be added to the LOD patch.  Right now, it is *NOT* part
      of the patch.
   b) This is just a beta version.  E-mail me bugs and comments
      to legion@nether.net with a carbon-copy (cc) to
      legion@gaianet.net.  Yes, I know there are bugs in the
      patch.  I won't list them here.  I want to know if people
      can notice them.  Why bother fixing bugs that nobody notices?

      Well, actually, I will mention one -- "NO FREE EDICTS".  Remedy:
      pick a better map or use fewer bots.  This is a problem with
      Quake itself.  There's nothing that can be done using QuakeC which
      this patch is obviously written in.

   c) Other than the modified super nailgun, there are no new
      weapons for PLAYERS.  Momentum on players when hit by some weapons
      have been modified.  Get shot with a double-barrel and you will
      see what I mean.
   d) use the listen parameter when invoking Quake.  For instance,
      "quake -game doombot -listen 16".  Make sure you type in lower
      case and not in upper case.  It is amazing how so many dummies
      insist on typing in upper case or worse, mixed cases like
      "qUAke - GaMe doomBOT -LiSTEn 16".
   e) I'm releasing the bot as a separate patch because I wanted to
      know if people liked the improvements I've made over the original
      eliminatorbot and roambot.
   f) two modified maps are included, START and DM6.
   g) impulse 200 to add the bots, upto 9.  There is no way
      to remove the bots except by exiting the level.
   h) read the individual text files for credits on other patches
      that were added to this patch.  There should be four text
      files.  Without those authors as well as J. E. Wright of Cujo
      v1.4, DoomBot would not have been created.
   i) there is *NO* substitute for intelligent roaming.  That is why
      I chose the eliminatorbot as a basis for DoomBot.  Other bots like
      the ZeusBot and the Reaper bot are no match for the DoomBot at the
      maximum skill level.  (This, of course, assumes that the map being
      used have waypoints.)  Why?  Because DoomBot can find all the good
      items like the Red Armor on the START map.  The other bots find
      these items by "accident". This is not good enough.  Some bots
      like the roambot, karnagbot, bgbot (and the "derivatives") and
      others can't even find the red armor.
   j) backpacks now contain all the weapons that deceased player had
   k) deathmatch 16 puts health in backpacks.  Don't use this setting
      with skill level 3 if you are a beginner.
         
   l) to use patch on a server, the clients must have a copy of
      throwaxe.mdl in their progs directory.  That's it.  The sounds
      are not necessary but if the clients don't want to get that
      annoying error message, then they should get a copy of all
      the sounds in the sound\axe directory, too.  The player.mdl
      is optional.  However, if they don't have the right player.mdl,
      then all the bots will look alike except for the colors.

   m) IMPULSE 200 to add bots.

   n) favorite: DEATHMATCH 128 to force axe only deathmatch.
   o) deathmatch 144 (128 + 16) to force axe only and have health
      in backpacks.

   p) Bots were designed for maps with waypoints but bots
      CAN BE USED ON MAPS WITHOUT WAYPOINTS.  For those of you who
      used the eliminatorbot before, this means that doombot will
      not simply jump around like an idiot.  Doombots will roam the
      map unlike the eliminatorbot.  Without waypoints, the bots
      are unfortunately easier to kill for the simple reason that
      the bots do not know how to get to the more powerful weapons
      and armor.  In other words, the bots suffer the same limitations
      as the Zeusbot, Roambot, BGBot, Darkbot, Oakbot, Reaperbot,
      TMBot, etc., etc.

      If you decide to use maps without waypoints, why don't you play
      a fair game by using deathmatch 128 rules? Jason does *NOT* throw
      the axe in these deathmatches.

   q) Jason bot is THE ONLY ONE who can throw the axe.  No other bot nor
      player has this ability.

   r) Jason is one of TWO bots that revives rather than respawn.  The
      exception is that these two bots will not revive in slime or
      lava.  The other 7 bots will revive based on chance.  Lower the
      skill, the less likelyhood that the bot will revive.

   s) Impulse 200 to add bots and please send bug reports, suggestions,
      comments as well as suggestions on how to remove bugs to
      legion@nether.net and legion@gaianet.net.

   t) grappling hook, 16 new weapons, and many other things like 15
      new monsters will be added.  This patch will be called Legion
      of Doom v0.90.  So once this bot is finished, look for
      LOD v0.90.  The current version of LOD does not have this bot.
      Instead, it has two bots: eliminator v1.4 and BGBot v1.6.  Those
      two bots will be replaced with DoomBot when I am finished.

      For those of you who have tried the LOD patch already, why are
      there only 16 new weapons since the LOD patch already has 17?

      The answer is that Jason will be the ONLY one with the throwing
      axe.  When version 0.90 comes out, the throwing axe will be
      removed for the PLAYERS.  So the PLAYERS and the other 8 bots will
      only have 16 new weapons.

      I might change my mind later on but that is what I am planning
      to do.

   u) Some of you might be wondering why I named the patch "legion of
      doom".  I really wanted to name my patch "ultimate" patch but there
      are two other patches by that name already.  I also considered
      "Killer Quake" but that name is already taken.  So I named it
      after my alias I used since 1988 when I started playing an on-line
      game called tradewars.  No, not the tradewars by the Martins.  It
      is the one where you can bribe mercenaries for three credits per
      fighter and where you can "trick" mercenaries to join you for free
      by leaving one fighter defense forces all over the place.  
   
   v) Some of you might be wondering why did I name the bot "doombot".
      Well, I liked the name eliminator and terminator but those names
      are already in use.  Although the author of the eliminatorbot is
      no longer continuing with the project, someone else has taken his
      place.  The terminator is a client-side bot, not a QuakeC
      (server-side) bot like mine.  But like I said, the name is already
      taken.  I could not think of any other name.

      I was tempted to name it "LagBot" after my alias, "I Cause Lags!",
      I used in playing netquake. But I decided not to.  For the curious,
      YES, there were dummies out there who actually thought that I caused
      lag when I logged on.  Some people simply don't have any brains in
      their head.

   w) You will need to start quake using the "-listen 16" parameter or the
      game will crash when you try to add more than three bots (assuming
      you are the only real player in the game).  So load quake by
      using one of the following:

         1) quake -game doombot -listen 16
         2) q95 -game doombot -listen 16

   x) For those of you who wish to practice loading quake, add the
      bots in single-player games.  DoomBot is a deathmatch-only
      bot. 


Extraction directions:
   a) create the following directories within Quake main directory
      doombot
      doombot\maps
      doombot\progs
      doombot\sound\axe
      doombot\text
   b) extract all *.bsp files into the doombot\maps directory
   c) extract all *.mdl files into doombot\progs
   d) extract all *.wav files into doombot\sound\axe
   e) extract all *.txt files into doombot\text
   f) extract progs.dat into doombot
   g) execute quake by
      quake -game doombot -listen 16

*NEW* extraction directions for v0.20b2:
   a) copy progs.dat into doombot directory
   b) execute quake by
      quake -game doombot -listen 16


Bot features:

   a) varying skill levels (0 to 3).
   b) uses waypoints to move around like the eliminatorbot.  Skill 0 to
      0.9 bots, however, do not use waypoints.  They roam around in
      random directions by spawning markers called "leaders".
   c) bot uses *ALL* weapons including the axe.
   d) bot can use buttons, platforms, etc., etc.  It can even exit
      the level so use "noexit 1" at the console.  Don't worry, bots
      don't jump around wildly.
   e) bots can swim, jump, pickup health, weapons, etc., etc.
   f) bots die in slime and lava, drown in water.  Will swim up for air,
      however.  So you can't trick bots to kill themselves by jumping
      into water.
   g) bots will chase enemy around as long as enemy is alive.  Will follow
      enemy into the water or slime.  Most of the time, it won't follow
      enemy into the lava.

      Neither the roambot nor the eliminatorbot can chase its enemy.  This
      is my own addition to the bot.  So it ain't perfect.

      What do I mean by chase?  Well, play the patch and find out.

   h) uses Jonathan E. Wright's findledge function of Cujo v1.4 to
      determine if bot should jump or not.
   i) uses new bot_movetogoal function rather than Quake's own movetogoal
      function to chase targets.  So bot can move over "cracked" ground
      pretty well.  For instance, try the rocket launcher corridor of
      the START map.  Bot uses Quake's movetogoal function when roaming,
      however.  So you will only notice the smoother movement when the
      bot is chasing you.
   j) bots show up on rankings with own name and colors.  
   k) bots use skins but players currently can not.
   l) bots can camp.  Criteria for camping is stricter for DoomBots
      than eliminatorbots.  Thus, a camping doombot is tougher to kill
      than a camping eliminatorbot.
   m) upto nine bots can be created, two of which are modified bots.
   n) bots make comments but only very few comments.  Will add more later.
   o) bot dead bodies are SOLID for a brief moment.  So jump over them or
      simply wait.
   p) other things but I've forgotten them already.

   q) send comments to legion@nether.net.  Try to include suggestions
      for improvements or corrections for bugs.

   r) for best results use three to five bots and use small (eg. START)
      to moderate (eg. DM6) size maps.

   s) I almost forgot: the bot's classname is player just like a
      real client.  I mention this for fellow bot makers who believe
      that you can't have a classname "player" for non-clients like
      bots.  Just make sure that you are not printing to non-clients.


NOTES:  Doombot does *NOT* cheat like the reaperbot.  It reacts quicker
        and aims better than real players but it does not cheat.  The bot
        is relentless in fighting unlike real players when they sometimes
        give up.  A bot armed with any of the nailguns or lightning gun
        is one very dangerous bot regardless of skill level.   If a bot
        is chasing you with a nailgun, unless the bot is weak to begin with,
        you will be dead within 5 to 10 seconds.  Get yourself a nailgun!!
        Against bots, these are your best weapons.  Hell, these same weapons
        are also their best weapon against you.

        The firing rate for bots are the same for players.  Okay, bots may
        be a little slower but the rate should not be noticable.  The
        only exception is skill 3 bots.  They fire 0.1 seconds quicker than
        other bots.

        You won't notice the difference between skill 3 and lower skilled
        bots, however, for the nailguns and lightning gun.  Bots can't
        fire the weapons any faster than you can.  I've tried.  They can't
        use the axe any faster either.  The difference, if you are really
        anal, can be detected in its use of the shotguns, grenade launcher
        and rocket launcher.
