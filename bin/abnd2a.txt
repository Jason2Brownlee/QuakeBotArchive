บ  Description of the Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

This is a combo patch that our clan had come up with to facilitate enjoyable play.

We really really wanted to call each other names, but due to distance constraints,
none of us could yell loud enough.  Enter the TAUNTS.  Bind any key to any of the 11
available taunts, and you have instant gratification ("I DO THE ASS KICKING AROUND HERE!")

We also enjoyed the Grapple / Rune combination from CTF, so we implemented that as well.
It now includes three additional runes:

	Rambo Rune:  Ammunition regeneration.  If you've got at least one of any particular
                    type of ammo, it will regenerate that ammo.  It also increases the
                    maximum amount of the ammo you can carry (Shells = 150, Nailz = 200,
                    Rockets = 150, Cells = 200).

	Mauser Rune: Also known as the "Rune Thief".  When you have this rune you can steal
                    someone's rune by simply attacking them and getting their health to
                    75 or below.  The target is notified, and (frequently) you can get the
                    upper hand (quickly if you steal strength).

	Dread Rune:  Pestilence.  Causes a "rotting" effect on any targets you hit.  After
                    striking a target when using this rune, the target will receive half
                    of the initial damage one second later, then half of that again another
                    second later.  This will continue until the damage is minimized below
                    one point or the target dies.  Also leaves a nice gib trail (good for
                    doggies to eat)

You must be extra careful of heights, however, as a long fall will cause you to drop your
rune (and it flies far).

Lastly, it was lonely on the many many levels we have fragged each other on, so we needed
some companionship.  Enter CUJO.  Faithful St. Bernard.  Get the WORST armor available on
the map, and you get a dog!  He will follow you to the ends of the level and attack
anyone who might possibly be good "gib" material.  Your dog will get additional health from
any "gibs" laying around, so gib quickly and gib often.

บ  How to Install the Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

Create a subdirectory under your QUAKE directory called ABANDON.

Extract files with the "-d" option to include directories.

To start at server, run QWSV +gamedir ABANDON

If you would like clients to be able to download the mods at connect time, you will need
to use a utility like WINPACK to extract the PAK file into it's subdirectories.
