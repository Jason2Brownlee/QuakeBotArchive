Dark_Skye made this so....if ya see bugs email me....

2.Added teleport fire patch in triggers.qc
3.Various minor stuff 
4."Fixed" team play in bot.qc impulse2.qc
5.Now injuryfull team play ¡¡YES!! in combat.qc
6.Now bots drown and stuff in botai.qc
7.Light'n gun bots!! in botai.qc items.qc

Skins and colours in DM and teamplay are "static" meaning
that the skin/colour you have when bots are spawned are used 
to set bot's colours/skins for as long as they play....
when you change your skin/colour they still keep their old ones...

Colours are used to determine teams here changing color will change
which team your on...bots choice of team is determined as follows:

<<<<must have teamplay on for this to work!!>>>>
i.e. if you spawned them with your colour = 3 and skin = 0 then:

your name here	skin = 0 + 0 = 0        colour = 3 + 0 = 3

Dark_ 		skin = 0 + 0 = 0        colour = 3 + 0 = 3

]L		skin = 0 + 5 = 5   	colour = 3 + 1 = 4

]V[		skin = 0 + 4 = 4	colour = 3 + 2 = 5

now to switch teams change yer colour(to join ]\/[ here change to color 5)
