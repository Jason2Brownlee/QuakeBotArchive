บ  Description of the Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

        This bot is diffrent the others, not because it is better...because
there are some better bots out there (Though this one is pretty good). Because
I spent A LONG time adding in other QuakeC add-ons into it. I am still working
on it though. Currently it has SuperAxe (Which the Bots use) and Eject. I also
have included some skins.
        This bot is also a clan of its own (I know, a clan bot?) Its name is
"The Butchers". They specialize in the Axe! I have included there clan Hall,
as a level that I made. (Not all that great, sorry) It includes there grave
yard, there registration area, there arena, and there maze. Try it out! I
have also included the skins for the clan. The offical one is the red and
grey guy. I also included some heads. Some of the heads will match the bodys
, others are just cool or funny. 
        Some of the features include

* Will use the super axe when you get to close

* Fully strafeing and dodges missles

* FlameThrower, Bots will also use it!

* Does not cheat (If any little)

* Swims

* Will no longer shoot at you if something is in the way

* Bodys will now stay around after they die

* Creates a bot Randomly so you don't always fight the same one

* The bots talk to you!!! (Real sound)

* More advanced navagtion from BG

* Has a new weapon "FireAxe" that will burn your apponents down

* Comes with eject built in!

* Good aim, but still possable to dodge

* Can help you in One Player as well

* Read the follow section for more info on ejected shells.

* Bodys stay around after death (BG didn't have this)

* Helmet lite, it better in dark places but then you are easier to spot!

* ChaseCam and its components (HUD system, Laser Sight, MultiSkin)

* Will no longer shoot at you if there is something in the way

* There leader "Burn" is a better and stronger bot

* Will now swim up if in water

* New monster MDL's for new play

บ  How to use Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

Make a directory in Quake (Type MD RBOT) called "Rbot". Copy the ZIP
file into it, and unzip it. Make another directory inside RBOT called
"progs" (It must be called progs.) Copy the player.mdl file into it.
Then goto the quake directory and type "Quake -game Rbot". It should run.
Impulse 100 creates 1 Random Bot.
Impulse 103 Goes into observer mode ("Must type KILL to get out")
Impulse 101 Is the score
Impulse 130 turn eject on/off
impulse 30 ChaseCam
impulse 20 HelmLight
impulse 31 LaserSight
impulse 200/201 Skin cycle

บ  Technical Details  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออผ

Bugs:

Some times if there is alot of bots there will be a packet overflow from
all the shells. Most of the time it will go away, but the best thing to
do is turn it off. Some levels arn't very good with eject on.

The bots can use doors, but they don't........old BG problem...

บ  Future Enhancements  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออผ

Better wandering (E-MAIL ME IF YOU KNOW HOW)

Fix it so the bots use the fireAxe as well

See the first one

The same old Crack/broken ground bug. (Would help if I knew what caused it)

Use of PowerUps (Quad, Protection, BioSute)

Use of doors....
