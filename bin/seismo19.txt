           Everyone involved in the QuakeBot C/S project and Jim Rorie
           for releasing the source to his bot (jfrorie@uncc.edu).
           sCary for posting us on his page.
           All those who took the time to e-mail suggestions and
           comments.

Yes, the COMPLETE programs and everything necessary to run them are in
the file Seismo19.zip.  We hate code bloat.  Both SeismoBot and
SeismoGraph are Win '95 console apps compiled with MSVC++ 5.0. They will
also run on WindowsNT.

**General Description**
In July of 1996 we got together and created two programs to collect and then
report enhanced statistics from Quake games.  Here is the latest version.

The first program 'Seismograph' reads the Quake or QuakeWorld -condebug
files OR Seismobot log files and creates a report with lots of the gory
details:

Reports include:
   o  Enhanced quake style frag list with stats per player
      -  # of kills made by you
      -  # of times you were killed
      -  # of environment deaths (lava, squished, etc)
      -  # of suicides (self kills by weapon)
      -  total time spent in game (with bot only)
      -  avg. time per frag (with bot only)
      -  avg. time per dying (with bot only)
   o  A DOOM-like frag matrix so you can get to the exacting detail
      of precisely how many times that camper was killed by each player <g>.
   o  A Per-player detail of:
      - # kills made
      - # times killed
      - net kills
      - a QuakeWorld style "Effeciency" rating for the game you played.
   o  A listing of who you killed first and who first killed you.
   o  A listing of all of the maps played (and the time spent in them if
                                           the bot was used)
   o  A detail listing of all of the recognized death messages within the
      log file.  You can see the most used and least used weapons.
   o  All player names are converted to their ascii equivalents
   o  **NEW IN V1.9: Team Scoring as comprehensive as player stats
   o  **NEW IN V1.9: Now works with QuakeWorld -condebug files
   o  **NEW IN V1.9: New command line arguments to make using Seismograph
      easier.

The report generator Seismograph comes with a death message text file which
is easily configurable to add any of the new weapons/deaths you like to play
with so they will be recognized and included in the reports.

Currently, there is NO LIMIT to the amount of messages you can use or the
amount of players that SeismoGraph will report on.  The only limit is RAM.

The second program 'SeismoBot' is a Bot derived from the QuakeBot C/S code.
You connect this guy to the server you want to log the events of.  He can
play along(he's a dumbass) or he can just log the events(not getting in the
way).  When the game is over you disconnect the Seismobot and you now have
a record of all the events which occurred during the game.  The bot stores
a timestamp with each message which Seismograph uses to calculate time stats.
You do NOT *need* the bot to use Seismograph.
