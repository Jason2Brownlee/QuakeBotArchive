Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

Have you had trouble taking good screen-shots, well this patch was design
to help.  You can now spawn these Target Player Bots where ever a player
can go.  They can be killed or gibbed by any projectile weapon.

Commands:
Simply start Quake with the 'Quake -game Place' or whatever
directory you put it in.

   Impulse  150 - Spawns Target player with an Axe
   Impulse  151 - Spawns Target player with a Gun

Source code is availiable for those who want it.  The code's nothing
special, basically it is just a bot that can't move or shoot.  Perfect
for those lamers who need to practise gibbing players.. :)

Known bugs
* Packet Overflow when you try to gib heaps of them at once.

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

Create a directory called place as a subdirectory in your Quake directory
(parallel to the ID1 directory) extract the archive to the place directory.

To play, type quake -game place from the Quake directory.  This modification
only works with the registered version of Quake.
