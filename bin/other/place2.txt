Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
It was suggested by the guys Planet Quake, that after the "Severed" patch was
released, that for the previous placebot patch might be expanded so that taking
cool screen shots of "Severed" people and/or their parts were easier.

The Place Bot Patch Mk 2 has taken that into account.

The impulses spawn the different placebots.  Once they're spawned, grab
a rocket launcher, shoot them.. and off blows an arm, leg or head.

Commands:
Simply start Quake with the 'Quake -game Place2' or whatever
directory you put it in.

   Impulse  150 - Spawns Target player with an Axe
   Impulse  151 - Spawns Target player with a Gun
   Impulse  152 - Spawns Target player No Arm
   Impulse  153 - Spawns Target player No Arm or Leg

Known bugs
* Sometimes the severing is a little slow in updating the frames.
* Packet Overflow when you try to gib heaps of them at once.
