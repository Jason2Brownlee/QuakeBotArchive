================================
HPB Quake Proxy (version 0.992b)
================================

HPB Proxy is a Quake Proxy that you can play through in order to
physically increase your ping (delay in sending/receiving updates).
Unlike some other proxies, HPB Proxy does NOT give the user a
"fake" ping.  It provides an interface to the connecting client
via the "say" Quake console command.  Thus, no messy impulses
are required.  HPB Proxy has a console of its own for controlling
settings.

Currently it is available for the following platforms:

 Linux 2.0.24 (Intel i486)
 IBM AIX 4.1 (HPB Proxy Version 0.9b only)

I believe it could be fashioned for other UNIX platforms.  I tried
porting it to Windoze but access to the timers seemed like a
real pain.

HPB Proxy is currently in its testing phase (and it may be that
way forever) so it may not be entirely stable.  If you want to 
ask questions, leave comments, or indicate problems with the 
program (or its documentation), email me at:

Change Log
----------
Keep an eye out for updates on the official HPB Proxy home page:
http://www-mddsp.enel.ucalgary.ca/People/dreveny/hpb 
(although I am not planning any new releases anytime soon -- I do 
have "real" work to do).

version 0.992b -- Big bug fixes (version 0.991b didn't work at all!)
   Also fixed some command line option stuff.  Thanks again to Frank
   for the quick feedback and beta testing.

version 0.991b -- Small bug fixes.  Also fixed a somewhat big problem 
   with the model precaching routine.  Somehow a target box model got 
   in there (leftover from the Itchy Bot source code).  This would 
   cause a Quake client crash if the client did not have the target 
   box model -- which hasen't been released yet.  
   Thanx to Frank Steiner for making me aware of this problem.
   I also made this version statically linked to avoid library
   inconsistancies on different systems.
 
version 0.99b -- Complete re-write of all the code.  This (hopefully)
   should make the proxy somewhat more stable.  Due to circumstances
   beyond my control, an AIX version will not be available (the
   AIX machine I have access to does not compile C++ easily -- too
   many changes to the rewritten code would be necessary).  But who
   uses AIX machines anyway? :)  Maybe someday I will re-write it again...

version 0.9b -- First public release of the proxy.


Who should use HPB Proxy?
-------------------------
Everyone who is tired of hearing other players say: "You damn LPB,
if your ping was as high as mine I would be wiping the floor with
you!"  If you have a good connection to a server (like being on 
the same LAN) you can now put yourself on the same playing field
as other players and show them who is the real better player.  
If you find networked Quake becoming boring because you are soooo 
good, you can use HPB Proxy to make a game with some newbies 
more interesting.


Usage
-----
     hpb [-port number] [-delay amount] [-verbose] server

Options
-------
     -port   number
         Specifies which port the proxy should listen for
         connections on.  Default = 26000.

     -delay  amount
         Sets the amount of desired delay (in milliseconds).  This
         corresponds to the amount of increase in client's ping.
         The delay can be set from the console as well as from
         the client.

     -verbose
         Turns verbose error messaging on.  (Used mostly for 
         debugging purposes.)  This can be toggled from both
         the console and the client.

The desired Quake server is also given on the command line in the 
format: quake.server.name:port.  Specifying the server port (i.e.
the ":port" part) is optional and defaults to the Quake standard
of 26000.  The server can also be set from the console (but not
while connected).


The HPB Console
---------------
After starting the program, HPB Proxy provides a console interface
allowing the user to set various variables without having to restart
the proxy.  The delay, quake server, and verbose messaging can be
set from the console.  The console commands are:

help
   This will give a printout of all the available console commands.

set server [server_name:port]
   Sets the current Quake server address.  If no server is given,
   it will echo the current Quake server.  This can only be done
   if the proxy is not currently connected to a Quake server.

set delay [amount]
   Sets the amount of delay (in milliseconds) which will result in
   a higher ping (by approximately the same amount).  If no amount
   is given, the current delay amount will be echoed.

set verbose [0/1]
   Specifies if extended error messages should be displayed.
   0 for off, 1 for on.  If no argument is given the current verbose
   setting will be printed.

disconnect
   Disconnects from the Quake server.

quit
   Disconnects from the Quake server, and exits the program.


HPB Proxy Client Commands
-------------------------
After connecting to the proxy (which in turn connects to the Quake
server), the client has access to the HPB Proxy Console commands.
To use the commands simply use the "say" command or just hit
't' (unless you have bound 't' to something else).  To specify a
HPB Proxy command simply start your message with a backslash '\'
character.  The proxy will then interpret the remaining as if it
were a HPB Proxy command.  For example:

say \set delay 100

will set the delay to 100ms (or increase the base ping by 100).
NOTE: Command messages will NOT be broadcast to other players.
