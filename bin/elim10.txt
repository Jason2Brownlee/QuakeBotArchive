Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

The Eliminator Bot package provides you with some decent adversaries
to play Quake against. Don't have a network connection? Maybe you
have a $100,000 LAN at home but no friends... Well, here is the
answer to your Deathmatch dreams. These automated deathmatch opponents
are by no means friendly and they'd just love to kick your sorry
behind all over the place. What's more, they aren't stupid like
most of the other bots out there. These know how to fight and know
their way around.

For further details see the README.TXT file in the archive.
