*  Description of the Modification  *
*************************************

Ever want to just kill everything really quickly and wihtout much trouble?  Well,
now you can, with your own personal Shambler Bot for you to play with.  This loyal
guy will quickly and efficiently kill everything it finds, including all of your
former friends.  Loads of fun in Deathmatches.  This code is a bastardization
of ThreeWave's CTF (ver 3.2) and ZeusBot (ver 1.0).  It includes the Grappling Hook,
and many other teamplay and DM options.


*****************************
*  How to use Modification  *
*****************************

Impulse 22  Grappling Hook

Impulse 100  Activates and Deactivates the monster

Impulse 104  "Fetches" the monster

Impulse 105  Makes 'em glow

Impulse 106  Reports the monster's status

Bind these impulses to keys to make creating and fetching the monster easy.
For example, to make the Q key activate and deactivate the monster, put this
line in your config.cfg file (or type it in the Quake console):

BIND Q "IMPULSE 100"

Now, every time you press Q the monster will be activated or deactivated.
You can bind the other impulses in a similar manner.


***************
*  IMPORTANT  *
***************

There are billions of other options including hundreds of various Teamplays,
Deathmatch 3, Runes, and various other Impulse commands.  These are due to the
morphing of multiple code sets, namely the ZeusBot and ThreeWave's CTF (ver 3.2)
code.  In fact, the PROGS.DAT for the Shambler Bot is fully ThreeWave Capture the
Flag Version 3.2 compatable - but in order to play Capture the Flag, you must have
already have set up and created your own CTF patch from ThreeWave.  You can get
this wonderful patch at:
http://quake.threewave.com/
You can find a short, edited version of many of these options in the TEAMPLAY.DOC
file, included in this patch.
Please note:  I am in no way taking from the hard work and monumental effort of
these two sources, but simply combining two great things to make another.  Virtually
all credit goes to both Mr. Wright and Mr. Kirsch.


*************************************
*  How to Install the Modification  *
*************************************

Create a directory in your Quake directory to store the patch in, such as
SHAMBLER.  Unzip SHAMBLER.ZIP and copy the file PROGS.DAT to this directory.
Then, add the line: -game shambler to the end of your command line for running
Quake.  For example:

quake -game shambler

In order to play Capture the Flag with your new-found friend, you should first
get and install ThreeWave's Capture the Flag Version 3.2.  Then, back-up your copy
of PROGS.DAT in your CTF directory, and then copy this PROGS.DAT into that directory.
Enjoy.


******************
* Other Details  *
******************

Features / Rules:

+ He hunts.
+ He can follow the player through portals, and he can be telefragged.
+ The Shambler will activate trigger fields (such as doors and traps).
+ Your Shambler will not be injured by your shotgun blasts or lightning,
  and his lightning will not hurt you.
+ Since Shamblers are magical in nature, should he become separated from you
  by a great distance, he will transport himself back to you.
+ He glows!
+ He is a shambler, through and through.  Rockets and explosions are hence not
  as effective against him.  However, he is slightly faster and much smarter than
  his game-time cousins.
+ He deativates when you die, but not when he dies.  This leads to rather
  interesting effects with disembodied heads...
+ IF YOU CHANGE COLORS (TEAMS), HE WILL DEACTIVATE.  This is due to the
  extrordinarily bad eyesight of shamblers, which leads to their getting confused
  when people begin changing colors on them.  Otherwise, he will respect and
  follow all Teamplay rules.


Bugs:

- The Shambler does not jump or walk past edges.
- He is "lost" after a level change.
- Shambler bots will not attack other Shambler bots.
- Please report by email any other bugs.

None for now.  This was just a little project designed to lower my GPA.
But, you can email me if you have any interesting ideas for improvements.
