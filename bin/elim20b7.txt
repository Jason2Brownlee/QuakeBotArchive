Future Enhancements   : Haha, you know the answer to this one.

Known Bugs            : If they die in lava sometimes they still
                        take damage, and emitt a pain sound after
                        they die.  This happens to players with 
                        fall damage, but it always has.
                      : Guts (Gibs) have been seen to "Float" in
                        the air.

Build Time            : Far, Far to long...

As you can see this is a decent readme, written by FuzzKatT. The last one
was done by me (Perged) twenty minutes before I went away, I had to scream
just to be allowed on the computer. Later,
