Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
TrevBot is just Trevor McDoanld with a bad
attitude. Partly Roam Bot V.0.9 with some extra
touches.

IMPULSE 100 creates a TrevBot. They can only be
gotten rid of by killing them.


How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
Make a new dir in your quake directory (ie: c:\quake\Trev).
Then extract the contents of this zip into that dir.
Move .mdl into new dir 'c:\quake\Trev\progs\', and .wav's
into new dir 'c:\quake\Trev\sound\weapons\'.
Run quake with the following command line parameter:

         quake -game Trev

Bind a key to impulse 100 to activate the bot.
