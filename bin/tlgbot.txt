Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
Yet another variation of TM Bot, it gives you our mascot bot 'Larva'.
Larva has his own model file, and texture, based on the Enforcer Model.
Just activate Larva and he'll be completely automated, or you can
take control and wreak some havoc with multi-player fun.

Plus, in deathmatch, Larva helps you out by killing your enemies, but
doesn't attack your teammates. Larva also notifies which player/monster
he attacks, and informs you once that player/monster is killed.

Instead of that pissy little enforcer laser, he is armed with a rocket
launcher for long distance foes, and a nailgun that he likes to use up
close (he's smart enough to know that a rocket up close HURTS!).

How to use Modification
-------------------------------
When you start the patch up, the control keys are
automatically configured to the default keys below:

Q  Activate Larva
W  Automatic/Manual

Automatic Commands :-
E  Fire Weapon
R  Toggle Auto-Fire
Y  Teleport to Player

Manual Commands :-
E  Toggle movement: Stop/Walk/Run
R  Turn Left
Y  Turn Right

To change these settings, modify the QUAKE.RC file that
comes with this patch, and change the following lines:-

bind q "impulse 100"
bind w "impulse 101"
bind e "impulse 102"
bind r "impulse 103"
bind y "impulse 104"

to whatever keys you like. For instance, say you wanted to
map the keys to your function keys, you'd replace the above
lines with:

bind F1 "impulse 100"
bind F2 "impulse 101"
bind F3 "impulse 102"
bind F4 "impulse 103"
bind F5 "impulse 104"

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
Copy the TLGBOT.ZIP file into your quake directory, and
unzip it by typing (without the quotes):

                   "PKUNZIP TLGBOT.ZIP -D"
                                       ^^
                               DON'T FORGET THE -D!

Then run the TLGBOT.BAT file in your Quake directory, or
if you want to do it manually, type "QUAKE -game tlgbot"
or "Q95.BAT -game tlgbot".


Technical Details
-----------------
Features/Bug Fixes:

        1. Manual or automatic control of Larva.
        2. Larva can draw enemy fire.
        3. Larva can activate trigger fields on the floor (like
	   the lights on E1M1 when going down the spiral ramp).
        4. Larva can go through teleport portals.
        5. Larva tries to return to player when player gets too
	   far away.
        6. Larva possesses a rocket launcher for long distance, and a
           nailgun for "Close Encounters".
        7. Larva has his own custom model file, and new sounds.
        8. You no longer get a frag if Larva kills you (in fact you
           lose a frag, and everyone gets a message telling them that
           your bot killed you).
        9. Larva will target any player who is not the same color as
           you, and any unfriendly bot as well (ones not owned by
           teammates).
       10. No longer has a 'co-op' mode (cause we don't play co-op).
           WORKAROUND: Have all co-op players change their colors to
           all the same color, and your bots will leave you alone....
           If I get enough feedback asking for it, we'll release a co-op
           version. Until then, NO co-op! (Still kills monsters though)
       11. Larva informs you of which monster/player he is attacking,
           and also informs you when/if he kills them.
       12. Larva will inform an enemy player if he is targetting them or
           their bot.
       13. Help file has been removed, due to some problems it caused
           on some systems. (Don't ask me why, the probs went away after
           the help was removed. It was an unneeded feature anyway...)

Bugs:

        1. Larva will accidently shoot you if you get in the way
           between him and his target (which will usually kill you
           considering the power level of his weapons).
        2. Larva cannot push buttons on the wall.
        3. Larva cannot jump.
        4. Larva cannot walk over broken ground.
        5. Larva sometimes gets lost.
	6. Certain functions (i.e. teleport, move, etc.)
	   interrupt the dying process giving you a ghost bot
	   that is insubstantial and unkillable.
        7. Level changes may not be handled correctly by the code
	   (Bot may not be deactivated, just lost).
        8. Changing your color during gameplay after you've activated
           Larva can be hazardous, as Larva will then proceed to attack
           you! (I left it in, so single players could go up against
           their own bot.....)
        9. Disconnecting from a netgame whilst your bot is still active
           leaves your bot in the game. Promptly reconnecting gives you
           another bot as well as your old one (this is considered
           cheating!!!!).
       10. And hopefully not many more.

else in this is ok to modify. If you want to create a bot
using this as a base, replace Larva's texture and name. If
you're no good at doing up textures, just use the enforcer's
one. We will kill you slowly if you use the name Larva and
his textures if you release your own bot, because those are
