DESCRIPTION: THIS COMBO PATCH IS MY 1st TRY AT QUAKE C!! I USED WIN95
WORD PAD TO CUT AND PASTE
THE .QC AND PROGS.SRC FILES AND QUAKECC TO COMPILE THEM. I GOT ALL THE
SOURCE CODE FROM
WWW.STOMPED.COM SO I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL THE AUTHORS WHO INCLUDED THE
SOURCE CODE WITH THEIR
PATCHES IT MAKES IT ALOT EASIER FOR AMATURES LIKE ME TO MODIFY AND
EVENTUALLY WRITE PATCHES FOR
QUAKE! THIS PATCH GIVES YOU 2 NEW MODES FOR THE GRENADE LAUNCHER,1 FOR
THE ROCKET LAUNCHER, CUJO
THE ATTACK DOG BOT,EXPLOSIONS BLAST OUT EXPLODING SPIKES AND SHRAPNEL,
LIGHT NAILGUN FIRES SPIKES
THAT STICK OR BOUNCE OFF WALLS AND EXPLODE WHEN THEY HIT FLESH SENDING
OUT EXPLODING SHRAPNEL,
THE SUPER NAILGUN ALWAYS LOOKED LIKE A GRENADE LAUNCHER AND NOW IT FIRES
GRENADE LIKE SPIKES THAT
STICK OR EXPLODE WHEN THEY HIT WALLS AND ENEMIES(NOT A GOOD IDEA TO USE
IN CLOSE QUARTERS ESPECIALY
SINCE THERE IS A SLIGHT DELAY WHEN SOME OF THE SPIKES STICK! BUT IT
LOOKS REALLY COOL WHEN YOU HOSE
SOMETHING DOWN)

NEW MODES!!!!!!

2 More Grenade Launcher Modes And 1 Extra Rocket Launcher Mode:

a) Firewall - a greande is released, after a few bounces it shoots up in
the air and explodes
releasing 10 more grenades that fall down to the ground and explode in
midair creating a sort of
a firewall. This takes 10 rockets.
b) Proximity Mine - as you set a mine, there's a 1.5 sec arming delay
before the mine is armed. After the delay is over, the mine floats up
in the air and starts rotating thus indicating it has been armed.
Although
it's possible to jump over a mine, it's advised to rather set it off
with
an explosion - a grenade or a rocket will do. The mine, if not
disturbed,
will self-detonate in 3 min.
c) Gibgun - similar to rocket , only when a gibgun rocket hits your
victim
it gets inside his body and starts rotating thus making your opponent
suffer a great deal. Finaly, the gibgun rocket explodes inside your
opponent's body often gibbing him to pieces.

To quickly check out this patch use 'impulse 9' console command to get
ammo and weapons then use '6' or '7' keys to switch between grenade
launcher
or rocket launcher modes. The Gibgun Mode has to be used on an opponent
or
a monster.

Allows missiles -- rockets, grenades, and nails -- to be teleported.
Fire a barrage of grenades
into a teleporter and rest assurred that anyone unlucky enough to be
standing near the teleport
destination will get a nice surprise.

Spikes now live on after they hit the walls. Some of them deflect and
bounce all over the place.
Some stick in the walls for a time before falling to the ground and
disappearing. Certain Nails,
when they hit something that bleed, explode, when they hit a wall,
ceiling, floor, or other
structure, they explode or stick, if they stick it will arm after 1
second, then after 5 seconds
fall, sometimes it may explode.

CUJO!!!!!!
a personal attack dog which will follow the player and attack his
enemies, even drawing fire in
the process.

The dog will not attack zombies, since it cannot gib them.

This bot is based on original dog code and some code from DM Bot 1.0.
The dog does not have any
manual control functions like those bots do. He's all auto or he's
dead.

Impulse 100 Activates and Deactivates the dog

Impulse 104 Teleport the dog to your location.

Impulse 105 Turns on Cujo's collar lamp. Great for dark places.

Bind these impulses to keys to make commanding Cujo easy. For example,
to
make the Q key activate and deactivate Cujo put this line in your
config.cfg file (or type it in the Quake console):

BIND Q "IMPULSE 100"

Now, every time you press Q Cujo will be toggled between his active and
inactive state. You can bind the other two impulses in a similar
manner.

þ Cujo can draw enemy fire, lessening the amount of damage the player
takes.

þ Seeks out monsters or other players and attacks them.

þ Will continue to attack as long as an enemy target is visible.

þ Will not attack teammates under Teamplay rules.

þ Cujo can follow the player through portals.

þ Cujo will not activate trigger fields (such as light triggers and
traps)

þ Cujo is trained *not* to attack zombies, allowing you to toss a
grenade
in there without blowing up your dog in the process. (But he will
sometimes lick their gibs when your done - hey, dogs will be dogs!)

þ Cujo is a special, genetically enhanced breed of Rottweiler with 8
times
the endurance of other dogs his size. He can cause up to twice as
much
damage per attack as his piddly cousins, too. And to top it all off,
Cujo is wearing a special suit of armor designed specifically with him
in mind. Cujo is one *bad* dog.

þ Cujo cannot be injured by your shotgun blasts, axe, or thunderbolts,
but
you can hurt him with nailguns and rockets, so keep this in mind when
firing at an enemy your faithful companion is already tearing to
pieces.

þ Cujo is equipped with a special device based on slipgate technology.
Should he become separated from you, you can teleport him to your own
location instantly. Cujo is even smart enough to activate this device
on his own when the distance becomes very great.

þ Cujo does not need to be fed. He takes care of this himself.

þ Cujo just loves to tackle big Shamblers while you put the nails to
'em!

þ This is not Sea Quest, so no amount of technology will allow you to
talk
to an animal. He jsut growls and barks like animals do.

The wisp is a flying bot (that resembles a lava ball due to a lack of a
more accurate model) that
you can summon and banish at will, freeze/unfreeze, recall, and even
ride with! It will attack
other players and monsters that it sees, and hunt semi-intelligently for
targets when none are
near.100 Summon/banish wisp Creates/destroys the
wisp. There can be only one wisp per player.101 Recall
wisp Teleports the wisp to your current position102
Freeze/unfreeze wisp Freezes the wisp into its current
location. In this state the wisp will not even
attack.103 Ride wisp/drop off The wisp grabs you to
itself, wherever you happen to be, and drags you behind
itself through the air. You can look around and fire your weapons in
the same way
as when you are on the ground. The wisp drags you through any hole it
passes
through itself like you were made of putty.
Bugs:

þ Cujo does not jump or walk past edges unless he is attacking, at which
point he can fall into water and become lost (I hope to find a way to
fix this...)

þ Cujo gets lost, it happens pretty often.


þ Sometimes Cujo will continue trying to attack an enemy, even when he
can't see it. Teleporting him to you will fix the problem, as will
finding
and killing the enemy he's after.

The wisp doesn't like cujo very much if they meet cujo will get
fried!!!!!


Theres alot of spikes flying around with this thing.

After the wisp searches around for a while it sometimes will just quit
roaming and wait. I guess
it gets tired of flying around in circles.

Sometimes a missile, especially nails, fail to teleport. Some
teleporters teleport missiles in the
opposite direction that they teleport players.

Spikes sometimes stick in a player or enemy, and when they move it just
hangs in mid air.
If you find and more buggs or know how to fix them let me know!!

I lost the source code when i reformatted my hard drive, the backup was
bad. Sorry if i make another
version I'll include it!!!

Tell me how you like my patch and what you think I should do to improve
it!
