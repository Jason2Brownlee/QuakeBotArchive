The (maybe) last release of Wyrm (1)!
Wyrm beta 2 + Wyrm beta 2 FIX = Wyrm FINAL :P

WHAT IS WYRM?:
Wyrm(1) is a big compilation for Quake Classic, that includes a lot of 
new weapons, new monsters and new features :P also, it can be played 
in CTF, and is fully compatible with all the 3wave CTF maps.

INSTALLATION NOTES: Copy wyrmb2final.zip into your quake directory, and
unzip it RESTORING PATHNAMES... something like
pkunzip -d wyrmb2final (or wyrmb2~1 :P)
for DOS pkunzip...

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR QUAKE 1.06 USERS: if you're using the 1.06 version,
it's highly recommendable to upgrade it to 1.08 (it's free...). If you
can't upgrade, there is an option to make Wyrm fully compatible with
Q 1.06 (see Wyrm.cfg).

ALL THE OTHER STUFF... : Read the wyrmb2.txt and the wyrmb2f.txt files
:P

WYRM 2 (for Q2): soon :P

Enjoy!
