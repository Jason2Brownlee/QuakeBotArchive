This is the .qc source code of The Place Bot Patch.  Feel free to modify it
and distribute it as you wish.

Known bugs
* If you try to gib to many of the bots at once, you will get packet overflow
errors.

Note: There is no limit to how many bots can be placed in a level, but too
many will cause Quake to slow down and give packet overflows.
