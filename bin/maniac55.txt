Author info     : Thomas Hansen. aka Grimm Reaper
                  Master/head/Lord of TKI.
                  Lives for only one thing,,,QUAKE / Q2
Pre-credit      : ID, in the old days there was doom, a good game and
                  i must admit i played loads of hours with it, created some
                  levels, and even got: ultimate doom and doom2.
                  i played (sorry id.) duke for some while and then duke atom
                  BUT THEN, i got my hands on quake, guess what i did to the
                  rest? (delete: doom1 doom1u doom2 duke dukeatomic)
                  all i needed was: Quake, and it still rocks any of the ones
                  above,,, THANX ID GAMES !!! (quake 2 is out, i must have it)
           addon: I just got Quake2 test version, some minor bugs, but it
                  will do just nicely.
Comments        : Big text file i know.
                : Because there are so many weapons and other add-on's
                  from just about all the patches I got, it's obvious that
                  their bugs, maybe a few more, maybe a few less, are
                  also in this patch. (probably more, since some might
                  not be 100% compatible.(like the dartgun which is no longer
                  a part of this patch))
                : You MUST unzip this zipfile using the -d option!!!!
                : If there is anyone out there that wishes to join this team
                  (two man work at the moment) so: if u create good levels,
                  skins or u are a good programmer, or just plain good at art.
                  just send a mail.
                : To create a T-c i need a team, i was thinking of:
                  The secret of mana (a cool rpg for the snes)
                  Zombies, quake for undead only (maybe i'll do this for
                  quake2 only...
                  Some way of improving the hand to hand fighting in quake.
                  and the best: Quake Bomberman!!!! (with special level)
                  just think of the things that are possible using the quake2
                  engine.
                : creating this patch gave me much of experience, and i am now
                  working on several other patches too.
/*
First! Place this patch in a directory like:
c:\games\quake\maniagun
and place all files in this dir.
then type (from the quake dir.) quake -game maniagun
Start gibbin.
*/


******************************************************************************
Main thing:
The extra patch(2) allows your shotguns, rocket weapons and others.
to fire more than 10 units a second.
Mind the guy with the sniper, eek!

This patch (and the prog.dat) makes them fire 0.1 sec faster.
******************************************************************************

Add all missing qcc files to the src dir(amtest boss fight jctest misc models 
oldone sprites and tarbaby.qc) then run proqcc 

v5.5
Extra since older versions:
***************************
re-did some art on the v_shotx.mdl
nothing much.

***************************
v5.4
***************************
http: geocities.
added a better looking model for the 'gattling gun'
or simply supr nailgun.  (am working on lazer, gattling lazer and dual-dual
s-shotgun  [cool heh?])
so: could someone tell me how to use multiple models on 1 [1..9] key.
    or must i find out myself?

i now have quake v1.08, get it at http://www.gamesdomain.com

***************************
v5.3
***************************
got rid of unchanged qc files (therefore reducing size of zipfile)

***************************
v5.2
***************************
http: crosswinds

***************************
v5.1
***************************
Tki player skin.

Got rid of the dartgun.qc code completely.
so no more irritating text when u press (4).

also updated the weapons(2).qc (0.0 reload time)

***************************
v5.0
***************************
i got a new e-mail adress

***************************
v4.9
***************************
Got rid of the progs.dat to make the final zip file smaller.
Also got rid of the qccdos files in the src directory.
(more easy to up/download)
The size of the zipfile is now almost half of the origigonal!!!!!!!!!

***************************
v4.8
***************************
Behold the super nailgun has become a 6 barrel chaingun,,, COOL!!!!

***************************
v4.7
***************************
now uses a cool looking shotgun that shows a hand which reloads the shotgun.
quake2 uses weapons this way.

(tried to use a special model for sniper, but no luck (yet))

***************************
v4.6
***************************
New death text when a player dies by the lightning gun.

(used on quake 1.06) (u can tell)

ehhh,,, i was trying to find the introduction text,,, but i can't find it 
anymore!!!!  (embarrasing) (did i spell that right?)
though i am glad i said 3.7 or higher instead of 3.7 (that would have sucked)

U still get quad damage by picking up a backpack that has (i don't know what)
i it,,, it is kind o cool.

now uses progs dir for models and src dir for qc files

***************************
v4.5
***************************
fucked up this txt some more. Made it better. ( well,,, i just changed it )
nothin' special

***************************
v4.4
***************************
Added or..... changed the older version of the grappling hook into 1.09 
instead of 1.05, and it is a major good thing too.

updated weapons.qc in progs2 to v4.4 too (it was still at 3.6 (stupid!!!))

Also added proqcc v1.53 (4x faster than qccdos)

***************************
v4.3
***************************
fixed bug that gives you the lightninggun, supershotgun and the nailgun:
when you pick up the nailgun. bug fixed.

Now the dartgun no longer works? Who cares it sucks anyway. (damn!) 

***************************
v4.2
***************************
I had some time left to add new: ha you died texts for the new weapons.
so it is done.

***************************
v4.1
***************************
And,,, Oh yes, finally the biggest bug is: GONE!
It is now save to use the extra weapons in water, or anywhere else.
Because you no longer switch to the lightning gun when using one of the
xtra weapons. YEAHHH!!

More easy to teleport non living items. (grenades?,,, hehehehehe!)

***************************
v4.0
***************************
Similar to the fake objects i added in an previous version,
These new killers look the same, but go BOOM if you touch them.
If anyone in deathmatch dies because of this, they will get a negative
FRAG in the name of worldspawn, you get nothing but the pleasure of
hearing / seeing your enemy go WHAM!
I am yet trying to make them vulnerable for rocket weapons.

***************************
v3.9
***************************
The Painbringer 
Horrific power at close range, crap gun at long range.

***************************
v3.8
***************************
The creators of teamfortress had a few nice weapons,
so i added them.
Sniper      (very high powered shotgun with long reload time) 
AutoSniper  (Same weapon, less powerfull, much shorter reload time)
AutoCannon  (Less powerfull supershotgun. with much faster reload time,
             a less spread bullets, just more powerfull)

***************************
v3.7
***************************
Only one small thing: when you fire an extra weapon. you see the weapon,,,,
well,,, how to say,, reload?

***************************
v3.6
***************************
Well i made a made a solution for the: you need cells problem.
It's no good though. Type impulse 99 anytime (even deathmatch)
to set the ammount of cells you own to ]30[ .
It's like cheating, but until the big problem can be solved, this will
have to do. Atleast now all weapons can be used, even at the beginning.

Also a stupid mistake on the text that appears when someone 
gets a telefrag, has been fixed.

***************************
v3.5
***************************
A poisonDartgun. used with the nailgun

***************************
v3.4
***************************
As I said before, i wanted to play deathmatch vs the CPU.
This is now possible. (BG bot v 1.5)
In single player: one helper will be created every time you hit (F)
it will spawn at the player's start point.
In deathmatch (at any time) 5 bots will be created.
The ammount of bots in deathmatch is regulated in impulse2.qc, just check.
They will spawn at random positions.

Cujo hate bgbot's even in single player game

***************************
v3.3
***************************
At last a bot.
His name is cujo and he's been created by (see credits)
It is an attack dog! And uhhh,,,, doesn't attack YOU!

comment: Cujo is a movie/book by stepen king, in this movie he is a 
         saint bernard,,, not a rottweiler. (but still a killer dog)

***************************
v3.2
***************************
Flare is now used with the shotgun.

Also I had a big cleanup in the impulse command, this text and the config.

***************************
v3.1
***************************
Tracer can now be selected in rocket launcher mode.
Even the RTB can now be selected this way. (by pressing 7)
And the Glue bomb  (7)
And the Ricochet grenade (6) 

The Light bomb has a longer range, and now lasts 2 seconds before,,,,light
goes on.

***************************
v3.0
***************************
At Last, the next generation has arrived:
Maniacgunz v3.

This time I finally was able to add the stinger to the {press 6 multiple times
row.}
And i promise it will not be the last!

***************************
v2.8 / v2.9
***************************
Finally the spikes/nails are a bit more usefull,
just check it out. (it's explosive!)

Also the maximum ammount of ammo is now:
250 shells
250 nails
100 rockets
200 cells

Added Tracer:
Sticks with your enemy (until death)
makes a random ammount of sounds, that get louder when you get closer
( once again: great for deathmatch )

added Lightning bomb:
Afther 2 seconds,,,,,
Everyone in the room goes blind for 15 seconds

Throw backpacks now last forever

Most Fake items now last 10 minutes (unless they are picked up)

***************************
v2.7
***************************
Gibgun:
The spinning rocket
just press 7 a few times.

Firewall:
Sort of a cluster bomb
just press 6 a few times.

Proximity mine:
hehe... Land Mine!
just press 6 a few times.

Check out progs2 to make these weapons fire at 0.0sec reload time too.

***************************
v2.6
***************************
Fake grenade.
It looks like the grenade, but does nothing.
Also it can be picked up, giving you,,,,,,,, (indeed) nothing
to throw and scare your enemy.
also:
Fake Ring of Shadows.
Fake Pentagram.
Fake Quaddamage.
Fake Biosuit.

***************************
v2.5
***************************
Sucker! backpack:
Delete some ammo from your opponent.
Perfect for Deathmatch! (Dig?)
Lasts 3min.
Makes a sound when: thrown\picked up.

The throwbackpack now lasts 5min.
and looks like a nain or spike, so that your enemy won't be able
to find it (and steal it) so easily.

Flare now looks like the hell_knight's spike, so that:
1: It looks cooler
2: Your enemy can see it more clearly (coming by)
3: It sticks out of the wall like a very small pin.
4: This is NOT the work of klaus
Stinger makes sound.

***************************
v2.4
***************************
This version includes 4 tools from:
Massive Carnage Industries
bug: The weapons use ammo and will run out, so the default grenade
and rocket launcer can't be used anymore.
BUT!: When you continue to use these weapons, your ammo re-sets,
so having 254 rockets and unlimited weapons (by klaus) but not
able to use the default.

*Flare
Brings light.

*Radio Tag Bomb (launch/detonate/defuse)

*Glue Grenade
Sticks on anything but doors and platforms.

*Ricochet Grenade
Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy.

***************************
v2.3
***************************
The shell ejection mod finally works.
Player and soldier now drop shells (ps: who made the shellcase.mdl?)

Since shells can easily cause a packet overflow,
I caused all creatures to gib at -30, instead of the previous -00.
packet overflows should rarely occur.
(Test: o.k. it happened once, when i was bitching up a large group
of creatures in nightmare skill.)

***************************
v2.2
***************************
I had some complaints about unfair deathmatch,
so I made a seperate weapons.qc for verrrry fast fire rate (witch all the
goods), and one with quite normal fire rate and also the goods.
just check \progs  for normal (most weapons fire 0.1sec faster than default)
     and   \progs2 for the real maniacs amongst you. 

Axe hits at (what I think) it's maximum speed (0.3)
this is really quite fast since the default is 0.5.
This should improve the need to live, even without ammo.

***************************
v2.1
***************************
A suicide button.
press (') to kill yourself (and take others along the ride.)
I was finally able to add the self destruct mod from:
Robert Beck (aka: whitetrash  (irc/EFnet))
this mod kills yourself, and others till a certain range.
So: If you'r short on health and have at least 5 rockets,
get close and press (') or type "impulse 69"

Throw a backpack.
throw some ammo into the level.
good for building stacks in secret places ( Deathmatch! )
(only one known bug: when you look slightly up, (and throw one) the
backpack may start to float.)

****************************
v2.0
****************************
Added easygib, now most monsters always gib, (unless the lazer or
grappling hook are used.

To make up for the :not enough ammo problem, i added a maximum
of 200% to be picked up by medikits. and 300 by the big health box
(you won't be able to pick up another untill you have 250%)

improved every armour by 25%

Added the stinger grenade (which only explodes in water)
(only it doesn't say you don't have enough ammo, when you are out of
cells, but it works.

A couple of those "ha you died" text have been edited.
maybe you like them, maybe not. (change them if you like, they are in
the client.qc) 

Added Zombies on the wall to be giggable.

Backpacks remain in the game for 3 minutes (instead of 2)

****************************
v1.2
****************************
added grappling hook, (took about 5 minutes) this thing is way cool.

****************************
v1.1
****************************
fixed bugs: Grenade launcher shot upwards, instead of forwards.
It was kinda funny though. (see v1.01)

Also your axe was hitting at maniac speed, only it didn't hit,
so it had no use, bug fixed. (now it hits at 0.4 :0.1 faster)

****************************
v1.01
****************************
The beginning of a huge patch!
fixed bugs: Rocket launcher and super chaingun didn't shoot
straight (about 30 degrees east or west), they do now.
(i was just finding out how the numbers worked in quake-c)

*****************************************************************************


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Planned events yet to come, later ( I hope ) 
1:All bug to be fixed (verrrrrry hard.(impossible?))
  if anyone can fix my bugs, please e-mail, or send a solution.
  please use unified diff.
2:add the lightning bomb to the lightning gun. 
3:Make cujo cooperate with bgbot, in single player game
4:Morph.  (don't have da source)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Bugs : cycle weapon command, don't work. It makes quake crash.
     : in the beginning, you can't use your axe. (somehow it wants cells)
       made a temporalily solution. (Z) gives 30 cells
     : Other weapons want cells too?  grrrrrr.

And here is for anyone that didn't know:
How to start a custom level (ownmade)
make a directory like C:\games\quake\xtramaps\maps
                       quake dir.   !  xtralevel dir
then start quake by typing quake -game xtramaps

then while playing a single or multiplayer game, pull down
the console (by pressing ` or ~ (just below most Esc buttons)
[whe call it the the tilde button]
then type: map fortress
               arena
               or anything else (depending on the customlevel.bsp)
