        Thanx to all!!!!

Also, special thanks to people that have send to me comments and bugs, and
to my brother, Jordi del Rio, for making the map included, the wyrm.bsp.



Please, excuse me for my english descriptions, because english is not my native

�IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII�
�  Description of the Modification  �
EIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII�
This is my first patch in Quake C. Making it I have learned a lot of this
powerful language (thanx John Carmack!!).
This is a Quake recompilation patch. Nearly all code has been modified by me,
in order to join and enhance them, and I think that the result isn't bad :).

IMPORTANT NOTE: Wyrm beta 1.5 if FULLY compatible with ThreeWave CTF 4.1 . If
you want to use them together, copy the Wyrm pak to pak2.pak, and copy it to
your ctf directory... if you join to a server that runs Wyrm, people will be
able to use the same maps as CTF...

TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE PLAYED TO WYRM BETA 1: I know some people may be
disappointed with this new version of Wyrm... I removed some good stuff, for
example, the new enforcer,the tripbomb and the KasCam... but this is due to
the important internal changes. To implement CTF I've to remove these things,
and maybe this version isn't as "spectacular" as beta 1... but this is a lot
more stable, and has the CTF game :).I promise to you that Wyrm beta 2 will
be much better... it'll contain 3 new weapons (or more), some more tipes of
enemies, and some surprise...

�IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII�
�  How to Install the Modification  �
EIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII�
Who doesn't know this??
Simply go to Quake dir, make a subdirectory, copy the pak file into it, and
run quake with:
quake -game <name of the directory>

You can add "-winmem 16" if you have Win 95, but it seems to work fine with 8.
This is a mistery why it work with only 8 Mb... the new pak file is about 12!!

�IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII�
�  SERVER Commands and Info �
EIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII�

Servers will receive all support from me. If you want to make a server send me
a mail and you'll receive all the information about the server side of Wyrm,
and, if necessary, a new PROGS.DAT with the Admin code enabled (with an unique
password, of course).

The following commands only works on the server's console, client side will
have no effect when these commands are entered.

temp1 1         - Disable shell casings.
temp1 2         - Disable auto-recharge in the handgun, the submachine gun
                   and the assault rifle (you can recharge with "impulse 76").
temp1 4         - Disable weapons aiming.
temp1 8         - Use smaller queue for temp entities.
temp1 16        - Use an even smaller queue for temp entities.
temp1 32        - Disable Anti-Camping stuff
temp1 64        - All players begin with the cheat command on :) (life reduced
                   to 250, to make it like DM4 :P)
temp1 128       - Disable entity generators (lavaburst, rain)

To use multiple settings, simply add up the numbers.

HINT: do you have a BIG lag??? just try setting the "deathmatch 4" and "temp1
209". I hope it will work fine ;).

The teamplay bit flags (to regule the teamplay game) are:

        1       Health Protect
                Players receive no health damage from teammates' attacks.
        2       Armor Protect
                Players receive no armor damage from teammates' attacks.
        4       Damage to Attacker
                A player who attacks his teammate will receive the same
                damage the teammate would have received, had he not been
                protected.
        8       Frag Penalty
                Any player who kills his teammate will be penalized frags.
                The number of frags to penalize is adjustable by a simple
                edit in the teamplay.qc file.
        16      Death Penalty
                Any player who kills his teammate will burst apart in a
                bloody mess.
        32      Team Color Lock
                Players will only be allowed to be certain colors.  Team
                colors can be specified for up to four teams in the
                teamplay.qc file.  Players who have illegal colors
                when they enter will be put into the team with the fewest
                members.  Any player who changes team (pants color) will
                be fragged and their frag count is reset to zero.
        64      Static Teams
                Players will not be allowed to change teams.  
        128        Drop Items
                ***NOT AVAIABLE ON THIS VERSION***
        256     Capture the Flag****YOU MUST USE THIS IF YOU WANT TO PLAY CTF****
                This enables Capture the Flag support.
        512     Custom Capture the Flag
                If you use Wyrm with the CTF maps, active this.
        1024    Enable the ability for players to select a team


        2048    Disabble Grapple Hook

        4096    All people have a light (useful on Night Mode)

        8192    Night Mode (all lights turn off)

        Obviously, not all these options make sense together.  teamplay 9
        doesn't really make sense, because you couldn't ever kill a
        teammate, and thus you could never incur the one frag penalty.
        To select multiple options, add the numbers of the options together.

        Examples:
        teamplay 96     Team Color Lock, Static Teams
                This results in players being automatically assigned to
                teams and not allowed to change to other teams.
        teamplay 3      Health Protect, Armor Protect
                You can't hurt your teammates' health OR armor.
        teamplay 28     Mirror Damage, Frag Penalty, Death Penalty
                When you shoot your teammates, you take damage and so
                do they.  If you kill a teammate, you'll take a frag
                penalty and you'll be killed.
        teamplay 120    Static Teams, Color Lock, Frag Penalty, Death Penalty
        teamplay 355    Static Teams, Color Lock, Health Protect, Armour
                Protect, Capture the Flag
        teamplay 483    Static Teams, Color Lock, Health Protect, Armour
                Protect, Capture the Flag, Drop Items
        teamplay 419    Color Lock, Health Protect, Armour
                Protect, Capture the Flag, Drop Items
        teamplay 995    Static Teams, Color Lock, Health Protect, Armour
                Protect, Capture the Flag, CUSTOM Capture the Flag, Drop Items
        teamplay 931    Color Lock, Health Protect, Armour
                Protect, Capture the Flag, CUSTOM Capture the Flag, Drop Items
        teamplay 2019   Static Teams, Color Lock, Health Protect, Armour
                Protect, Capture the Flag, CUSTOM Capture the Flag, 
                                Drop Items, Player can choose teams

�  How to use Modification  �
EIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII�
I've included the text files from the varies patches that I've combined,
and compressed them into TEXT.ZIP, so you could look at them and see
what the commands are, as well as the authors' email addresses.

Weapons recollection:
--------------------
-Super shotgun: if you get it and you don't have mossberg, you get it.
else, if you don't have the double-barrelled shotgun, you get it,
and if you have the other two, you get the assault shotgun.
-Nailgun:First you will get the MP5, and after the M16.
-Super nailgun: first the freezethrower, after the flamethrower, and after
the plasma gun.
-Rocket launcher: first you will get regular missiles, after guided, and
after homing.
-Lightning gun: first the lightning gun, after the Positron Beam, and after
the Proton Storm.

Impulse 1 weapons:
-----------------
* K-bar knife: a Navy Seal weapon :). it doesn't do so much damage, but it's
very fast and have a probability to chop enemies.
*Axe of Command: it has been modified, so you can shot to your minions.
This weapon can chop, too.
*Throwing Axe: I have modified it, so you can hold it for a while and when you
release it, the axe will move more fast, and will do more damage.
Other chopping weapon ;).
*Hand grenade: another weapon from Navy Seal patch. The explosion is one of
the coolest things i see in Quake. It's useful if you don't have weapons that
use rockets.
*Chainsaw: Well... it inflicts tons of damage and chop your enemies into
little pieces... what more can you ask for??

Impulse 2 weapons:
-----------------
Note: all three weapons are from Navy Seal patch.I modified them a little, so
they have automatic reload, aiming and cool particles when fired to a wall :)

*Colt M16 Assault Rifle: Good at long and short distance. Have a 30 bullets
clip.
*MP5 Sub Machine Gun: it fires more fast, but do less damage per bullet. It
also have a 50 bullets clip.
*Mk23 Handgun: Very good at short range, but bad at a long one. It has a
12 bullets clip.

Impulse 3 weapons:
-----------------
*Assault Shotgun: ANOTHER weapon from Navy Seal. It's like an automatic
shotgun, and consumes shells very fast.
*Double-barrelled Shotgun:Cool model from Deft. It has a long reload time,but
do 140 damage at once!! :)
*Mossberg 590 tactical shotgun: Oh! another from Navy Seal!. It's good to
save ammo, and for medium ranges.

Impulse 4 weapons:
-----------------
*Airfist: Is one of the coolest weapons ever made. It doesn't need comments :)
*Bucky ball gun: it has two modes -normal and flare-. The first will launch a
ball that will make an explosion every time it touch floor, and the other
burn everithing it touch.

Impulse 5 weapons:
-----------------
*Freezethrower: It's the one from Ice Ion patch, but nearly all rewritten!!
Now , ice bounce at walls, and it can... freeze the water!!!
*Flamethrower: the code is from Quake Command, but with a cool 3d model as a
flame, and a more cool weapon model from PAIN. When it burns someone, the fire
is like Blaze Gun.
*Plasma Gun: it seems like a 3-d version of DooM plasma...

Impulse 6 weapons:
-----------------
*Normal Grenades: well... they are... normal??
*Bouncer Grenades: they throw spikes when explode
*Cluster Grenades: when it explode, it throws a lot of normal grenades.
*Poison Grenades: it makes a cloud of poison gas that will poison your
enemies.

Impulse 7 weapons:
-----------------
*Normal Missiles: ...
*Guided Missiles: they cost 2 rockets, and you can seek and hunt your enemy
with it.:)
*Homing Missiles: as above, but the missile will make it for you.

Impulse 8 weapons:
-----------------
*Lightning Gun: the typical... no changes :PPPP
*Positron Beam:It cost 20 cells, but it has a bunch of damage. It can kill a
Shambler with one shot.
*Proton Storm: Cost 50 cells, and it ANIHILATES all... I had to put a fix in
order to stop it killing Shub with one shot :)))

Teamplay and Deathmatch:
-----------------------

New Deathmatch modes(only two):
* Deathmatch = 3
  Is simply a deathmatch with monsters. Try it with skill =3D 3!!!!
* Deathmatch = 4
  It's very stupid. A deathmatch with NOTHING. I think it's only useful with
  "temp1 81" in order to get a faster game.

Monster enhancements:
--------------------
I don't want Wyrm to be an only deathmatch compilation. I want also to enhance
single player game experience. To do this, I added some stuff...
-Grunts have different weapons (double-barrelled grunt can kill you with one
shot!)
-Ogres fire missiles if they are far enough from you.
-Enemies respawn in nightmare!! (now it will be really a NIGHTMARE! he he)
-Ogre, knights and hell knights can chop you  :)
-Added cranked. See cranked.txt for more details.
-Scrags fire much more :)

Map information:
---------------
-Added suport for Rain from QuakeX
-Added suport for explowalls (func_explo_wall)
-You can place "weapon_plasma_gun" and "weapon_chainsaw" in your maps.
-New things you can place:
        "monster_army_single"

�  Testing Notes  �
EIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII�
All Quake standard maps seems to run properly.
If you have Quake 1.06, there is an all-patches problem. Game will crash
if you load a certain number of maps... I think it's caused by the new
models... if you have Quake 1.07 or highter you won't get this error.

Normally, I test it with 16 Mb of RAM, but it seems to run well with 8 Mb.

I include a map: the WYRM.BSP . It's a very small map with all Wyrm
compilation map enhancements... You will get TONS of packet overflows because
it is sooo small to contain all the stuff :P ... if the map were bigger, I'm
nearly sure you won't get any... (or maybe 1 or 2).

I haven't test it on CTF multiplayer... 
The death camera is very bad if you don't get gibbed :)

Maybe, and ONLY maybe, I'll include the Deathmatch Essentials 1.1 ... it's
incredibly cool!

Maybe more teamplay modes.

standard quake :)
