Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
This is a deathmatch-style patch, though it can be used in single player.It 
changes all 8 of the weapons into totally new means o mass destruction. It
also has 1 new weapon. The bfg. I personally can't stand downloading
a huge patch and then finding out that it wasn't worth it. This patch is. 

Impulses are bound in the quake.rc file

*	It has SKINTEC. Not multiskin. If you change your skin, it STAYS.
If you die, you leave a good lookin' corpse. (Heads too.) When you change 
skins, you change your net name also, so if you want a custom name, you're 
stuck wit da quake guy. Use <E> or <R> to cycle through skins.
SKINTEC skins:

	Quakeguy
      ++The Crow
       *Jason
       *Mike Meyers
       *Freddy Kruger
       *Adolf Hitler
	OJ Simpson
      ++Pervert
	Devil CLown
      ++Lobo
	Terminator
	Predator
      ++Ska Man
	Dead Camper Zombie
	Grim Reaper
       *Potato Head
	Duke Nukem
	Dr Kevorkian
      ++Doom Marine

++ These skins by The Dire-Proto Fiend have so much detail, they deserve to
be seen in SVGA
*  These skins I drew, potato head being based on the dare devil skin from
	QUAKE SUPER HEROES (loud echo)

*	Also, if you pick up the biosuit, you look like the biosuit. 
Neat huh?

*	Reloading frames for the player's Shotgun attacks (sort of). 

*	Holo dude. Obvious. Use <H>

*	Snot (DMBOT) - He's a bot. With human bones as pants. And he likes to
wear people's faces. (Who knows?) Use <S> or <D> to toggle or teleport him.
The version in my patch is quite a bit deadlier than the original; he has a
Chain Stuffer instead of a Super Nailgun. Not my fault, but still cool.
He'll sometimes blow himself up because of this. 
 
***New weapons*** 

*	Axe of War - This is THE weapon of choice. It swings 3 times for each
time you fire, (though you only see two) and will put ANY enemy's health at 
			     ****** -40! ******
It can also block shots from the axe. So if you see somebody running at you
with the axe, kill em quick or duel em to death.

*	Shot gun - new model, little bit stronger

*	Super Shot gun - Not really new, but it takes longer to reload to
acomidate the 6 or so new frames. I increased the damage to compensate for 
this.

*	Nail gun - Now is the Chain gun. If you ever played DOOM or DOOM][,
you know what this is. Uses instant hits, like a shot gun. I need a 
g_nail.mdl to go with this.

*	Super Nail gun - Now is the Chain Stuffer, has a new model. Stuffs
enemy with nails two times as fast as Nailgun. The nails in victims body
inflict damage for about 20 seconds or untill the victim dies, then
they explode. Amount of damage and strength of explosion depends
on the amount of nails inside victims body :) heh, it does look funny.
Only uses one nail now.

*	Grenade Launcher - Now is the "Small Nuclear War Maker". You launch
a grenade, it sits there, then levitates. 20-80 seconds later, BOOM! in a BIG
way. It explodes, firing 20 more grenades at the ceiling, which bounce off 
stuff, then explode. If you dont want to wait to detonate, you can hit <X>.

*	Rocket Launcher - Now is the Get 'em up the ass gun. It fires a slow 
missile that flies around looking for ass. When it finds ass, it homes in on
it, and then goes up it. It stays there for a while, then blows up.

*	Lightning gun - Now is the Vampiric Lightning gun. It sucks health
from the victim, up to 500% health, then it does 5x the damage. You cant 
discharge into the water anymore.

*	BFG-9500 - When you pick up the lightning gun, you also get the BFG.
Now, anyone whose played _ANY_ DOOM game knows what this is. Press <8> twice
to select it.

****All of the above weapons were originally designed by Piramida, except
for the axe of war, BFG, and the ass gun. I only changed 
variables and names and stuff. It's their respective code, not mine.****
  
Known bugs
----------

You get packet overflows if you launch 5 grenades n detonate them.

Ther's a bug where when you fire the BFG, sometimes your Shotgun is removed
from your arsenal. If you try to select it, it says, "no weapon". This
sometimes also takes ALL of your weapons. The only fix is to start a new 
game, suicide, or to go pick them back up

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

If you don't know how to copy n unzip a patch yet you're a moron.

Get Pkunzip or something.
Unzip the zip into a directory of your choice. NOT THE ID1 DIRECTORY!!!
Run quake like this: quake -game <dir name here>
If your using Win95, type this: quake -game <dir name here> -winmem XX
Where XX is 5mb less than your total ram, ex:
If you have 32mb like me, you type "quake -winmem 27 -game <dir name here>"
If you have 16mb, you type "quake -winmem 11 -game <dir name here>"
Get it?
