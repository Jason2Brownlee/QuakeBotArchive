Impulse commands
================

impulse 200     Increment skin (if skins support is set)
impulse 201     Decrement skin (if skins support is set)
impulse 202     Toggle skins support - three settings
                (off, normal, skill skins)
                With skill skins mode, bot skin
                depends on its skill level
impulse 205     add a bot (can do it repeatedly)
impulse 208     add four bots
impulse 211     remove all bots
impulse 212     Toggle limited observer mode
		   (you are invisible to bots unless you 
		   attack them, but move normally)
impulse 214     update bots. Use when the 
		   SV_GRAVITY or SV_MAXSPEED 
		   server cvars are changed.
impulse 220     normal scores (frag count)
impulse 221     update team colors (used to tell
		   the bots on your team if you change
		   colors)
impulse 1XX     Bounds the total number of bots
		   + players to XX (XX must no
		   greater than 15)  Enough bots to
		   meet this bound are spawned, and
		   they leave and come back as players
		   enter and leave the server.
Skill N         Change skill level (N = 0 to 3, default
		   is 1)
impulse 15      YCam

For a list of other impulse commands or instructions on using and/or
installing the bot, download the reaperbot patch. Visit QuakeC Archives
(http://www.planetquake.com/qca) for the instructions on how to install
patches.

Please read all accompanying text files included in the WarBot package.
To start a game, use the following command line:

quake -winmem 16 -game warbot -listen 16

I suggest you play the Warbot with custom deathmatch maps. You don't have
to but I find I get the most fun out of the WarBot this way. A good place
to find some cool custom deathmatch maps would be Ramshackle at:
