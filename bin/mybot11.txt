I modified the tmbot qc mod to shoot grenades at zombies.
I cannot take much credit for this mod because i am not really a good 
proggrammer and the bot is mostly Micheal Polucha's (mpolucha@earthlink.net)
code.
Much credit to him!

New features since my first mod.
1. The bot goes into pain a lot less often
2. If the bot is attacking a target and is hit by 
another target then the bot attacks the new attacker
(phew)
3. The bot is three times stronger!





Check tmbot.txt for more important info!


bugs
1. the lazer still fires at zombies
2. grenade sound still plays for lazers

As i said i am not a real programmer so can someone please tell me when the fix it?
