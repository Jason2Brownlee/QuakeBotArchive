Quake vs. The Borg

RESISTANCE IS FUTILE...

so you might as well check it out.

Impulse 100 creates one Borg; you can use this command twice on a level.
Should be used in a Coop or Deathmatch level.

The AI is based on BGBot1.5, so they ain't too bright.  They will still
manage to assimilate you though.  I am posting this as a fat pak0.pak file
because it contains some .mdl and .wav files in there as well.

There are quirks, but shouldn't be anything fatal.  Also when there are 
alot of Borg the server will get bogged down.

Experiment and have fun.

This is version 1.2, below is a list of fixes and additions:

1.  Will work for people using Quake v1.01 (Oops!!)
2.  Contains support for multiple player skins.
	Impulse 201 Down one skin
	Impulse 200 Up on skin
	Impulse 199 Query what skin you are using
3.  Will remember which skin you are wearing between level changes.
4.  Site to site transport feature:
	Impulse 151 through Impulse 154, sets transport location
	Impulse 101 through Impulse 104, transports to set location
5.  Star Trek sound effects for the new weapons.
6.  Borg speak with a collective voice (really cool when there's a bunch of 
them in a room).
7.  Will adapt to the nail gun properly
8.  Works pretty cool with coop games.  Borg hunt the grunts on the level 
and assimilate them.

I think that's all of them.  Remember, to install it, put the pak0.pak file in a 
folder called Borg and use the command line "Quake -game Borg."  To spawn a borg 
use impulse 100;  and incase you didn't know already impulse 12 cycles you backwards 
one weapon.
