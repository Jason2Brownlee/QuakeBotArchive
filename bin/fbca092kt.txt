Description
===========
A Quake mod that combines the Frogbot and Clan Arena.


Installation
============
Unzip into your Quake folder.


Running the game
================

Create a folder fbca and Unzip into fbca folder.
Create a bat file:
---------
@echo off
cd..
quake\winquake.exe -listen 16 -zone 1024
---------

Important Notes
===============
- Refer to readme.txt and readme012c.txt for more information on the Frogbot.
- Included is fbca.cfg. Executing this file is an easy way to enable Clan Arena, damage frags, and rocket-jumping bots. Also, this sets sv_gamedir to "arena", so QuakeWorld clients won't have to download sounds if they already have them in their arena folder.
- You can only toggle chasecam during a match and if you are not playing. Attack toggles it on/off. When in chase mode, jump switches to the next client.
- You can use the reset command instead of reloading the map to change settings such as 'deathmatch' and 'arena'.
- When 'botrj' is enabled, the bots will always try to rocketjump instead of going the long way. If they don't have a rocket launcher, they will just stand there and do nothing. So, I recommend that you only enable this in modes where they will always be able to rocketjump, such as deathmatch 6 or clan arena.
