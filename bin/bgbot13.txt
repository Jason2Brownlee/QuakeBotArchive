Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
Basicly a TM and DM bot slightly modded. This bot
can pick up Health, Armor, Weapons, and Ammo. Also
chooses which weapons is better of the weapons it
has picked up. Also shoots all players and other
bots. You can create as many bots as you like, memory
allowing.

Impulse 100 creates a bot. There is no way to
get rid of the bots unless you kill it. They also
have control of themselves.

STILL NEEDS:
#1------Trying to get the bots score to come up on changelevel or when
player dies. Cant seem to figure it out.(ie brain fried.)
If anyone can lend some insight, lemme know.
#2------Ability to walk into water, swim, jump, and walk over cracks
in floor.
#3------Better roaming AI.
#4------Need to figure out how to change his colors. Random or

otherwise.
#5------In Teamplay, Coop, and one player he is pretty useless on any
level that has cracked floor, stairs, water, etc.

VRESION 1.30:
Model is now the player model. He has the same colors as you.
Fixed minor sound bug. (ie no sound when he fires.)
Slightly improved roaming ai.
