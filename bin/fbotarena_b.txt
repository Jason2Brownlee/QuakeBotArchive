Title :    FbotArena_B
Author:    surgeon
           http://members.xoom.com/surgeonsq1/index.htm


Note: This is a small update for FbotArena
      "bot" will add a bot of specified skill (skill 0-100),
      as opposed to the other predefined bots

      Erazor released a new version 29/6, so I hurried to implement the
      parts relevant to arena. This includes fixed waitingromm spawning
      and correct name-printing and spectator stats.


      The files in this archive should replace the ones in the original:

      progs.dat
      frogbot.cfg
      alias.cfg
      bots/legioneer.bot (new)



Introduction:
-------------
  OmicronbotV1.2 was until recently the only quakebot with support for
  RocketArena.
  It's wasn't possible to FPS-optimize this bot in the usual way,
  since Mr. Elusive holds on to his source code.

  Now, the best bot available (Frogbot by Robert Field) has gained
  RocketArena support, thanks to the effort of EraZoR.

  I was initially disappointed in the slow speeds on my 060/66,
  which probably is due to the frogbots liking for shaft
  (constant dynamic lightning isn't good for performance).
  So, I did something about it and now it's a lot faster.

  Only "problem" is that this bot's weapon choice and hitting
  accuracy is a much better than the omicron :)


Credits:
--------
  This is a modification of a modification of Robert Field's Frogbot...

  FbotArena is based on the Frogbot 0.13 Test source with
  RocketArena support added by EraZoR.



Changes compared to "Frogbot 0.13 TEST With Rocket Arena suppport":
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  New commands:
  -------------
  "wkick"   togles weaponkick on/off
  "blood"  toggles blood on/off
  "filter" toggles sprite/teleport explosions and
                   half/full visual shaft-updates (improves framerate)

  internal stuff:
  ---------------
  NOFLASH option is enabled by default
  Think Intervals increased by 30%
  (don't know if this helps framerate, but bots does play equally good)
  Dynamic light disabled.
  Torches & fire removed.
  Explosions remodeled.
  Dead Bodies removed.
  Reduced gibs.
  Framerate printing remodeled
  RocketArena map-rotation on 5 fast maps (in PAK0.PAK - no maps needed)
  Missile exchanged for grenade

  other:
  ------
  Added progs dir containing bolt2.mdl (shaft replacement)

That's it : 50% faster than the original "fbarena013" during combat
(according to the framerate printing)

Enjoy...
