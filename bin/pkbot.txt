Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
The Reaperbot merged with Painkeep. You need Painkeep in order to use this bot.
(http://www.teamevolve.com/). Also, for more information of the Reaperbot along with complete
impulse commands, you should download the Reaperbot from the (pub/idgames2/quakec/bots) directory
at ftp.cdrom.com.

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
To start off, go to your Painkeep directory and rename progs.dat to oldprogs.dat or something
similar. Then extract this progs.dat into your Painkeep directory. You should either have the
pkbot.cfg executed in your command line parameters or executed in your autoexec.cfg or whatever
file you have that is automatically executed for Painkeep. As mentioned above, you should already
have the Reaperbot and Painkeep and just refer to the significant readme files for all the
necessary information. 

Technical Details
-----------------
All the usual Reaperbot bugs are present in this bot also. They also do not use damage skins, 
don't use multiskins, aren't affected by beartraps, they only use the default quake weapons, etc.

Author Information
------------------
The author who merged this patch goes by the name of Decker and doesn't support it, I just
downloaded this from a bot page and wrote the readme to go along with it. The author of the
Reaperbot is Steven Polge who now works for Epic Megagames and was responsible for the Unreal
monster and bot ai. The Painkeep authors are Team Evolve and are currently working on a secret
project due to be released in a few weeks (as of this writing). I, loknlode, have nothing to do
with the creation of this file. I simply put it together with this readme and config file. My
email is dennis_n@pacbell.net. I really don't want any emails about this mod, as I will probably
ignore them. If you want more information about bots I suggest you go visit Randars Bot Page
(http://www.ionet.net/~mimpchnk/).
