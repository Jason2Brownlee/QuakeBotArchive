Many thanks to ID for this superb game.


Update:Bots can be identified by their red eyes, also skin colour

Bots are tougher now, and start with the normal shotgun

Bots fire rockets more than before

Rocket Launcher Ammo changed to 10 per shot

Ammo needed for prox mines & pipebombs 5 grenades
(make you use more sparingly)

Params for Homing Rockets changed, dont take long to blow
(but enough time to fire 2 or 3 to give a huge explosion)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Combines:-

Deathmatch Bots (max of 12 - depending on mem)
Comrade Bots (AI is not perfected yet)
Start with Shotguns, but dont let these guys
get Rocket Launchers or Armour, they are tough.
when they kill you your frag will -1
so you can keep track of score.
Bots can jump
Bots frags are displayed when they die


Tractor Beam (Lightning gun changes mode)
Pipebomb (weapon 6 toggles)
Prox Mines (weapon 7 toggles)
Ammo needed for prox mines & pipebombs - 5 grenades
Texture for grenade can be changed (invisible mines!)
Timed Grenades for normal launcher
(type Temp1 x (x is time) at console)
Zombies on walls can be gibbed

Electro Bomb (Throw into water, 5 secs, fried enemies)

Laser rifle (Replaces shotgun)
Tough weapon, but it eats shotgun ammo.
When used in combination with Quad Damage
fires tons of lasers.

Lightbomb
Throw this a room and watch'em run for the exit
Blinds all in prox for 15 seconds, easy targets! (not bots)

Extra Gibs
Twice as much gore, Three times as much
on Shamber & Fiend

Power Axe
Twice as strong as before, actually worth using
when you have ammo!

Sticky Homing Missiles
Home in to enemy, sticks up arse, then blows up after approx 3 secs
watch the smoke trails as they run! (COOL)

Give a Backpack
Face your team mate and press T (impulse 55)

Foot steps for deathmatch
