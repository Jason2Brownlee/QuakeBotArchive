�  Description of the Modification  �
�����������������������������������ͼ

This is a combination patch of the various patches which I've listed
in the above credit list, as well as many other original patches created
by myself.

I've tried my best to make sure they all work well together, and if they
don't, please let me know by writing to me at howard@mortimer.com

I've given full credits to all the authors of the varies patches that
I've compiled into KQP, without their cool work, KQP would never even
exist.

The first time I played Quake with the cool patches, I was impressed on
the cool stuffs that you could do with Quake C. I've tried dozens of
patches created by others, and can never get enough from them.

Then I came up with a new idea. What if I want to use a weapon from this
patch to toast a new object from that patch? So I start to dig up the
sources code of the various patches that I've, and try to combine them
together.

There are many hot patches out there, and I just can't combine all of
them into one, so I'll have to decide on which to take, and which not to.

If you liked the patch, great, let me know, and tell me what other patches
you want me to put into the package.
