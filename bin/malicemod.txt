This is a speedup modification for malice with the addition of a dm-bot. 
I have adapted the tutorbot from AI Cafe to malice.  
It plays ok, and shows in the rankings like players.  
New in this version is waypoint navigation (less cpu demanding),  
improved aiming routines and added skill levels(Skill can be set at any time). 
The bot also picks up weapons and items, can use lifts and teleporters.  
However it still can't use hoverboard, parachute and such... 
Waypoint support is currently limited to ddm4 and ztndm3 
(custom quake deathmatch level -works fine with malice)  

  
Installation:   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to patch:
The supplied script "PatchMalice" asks you to pick the PAK1.PAK in your
malicedir,
select the patch (pak1.pch) and choose the output filename (example:pak1.new)

When the patcher is done (this may take a while), store your old pak1.pak
somewhere else, in case you want to use it again.
Now rename the newly generated pakfile (pak1.new or whatever you called it)
to pak1.pak.

After patching and renaming, copy the supplied autoexec.cfg to your malice
dir, and start malice as usual.
   

Usage:   
New console commands:   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type "boostfps" in the console, and flashes from your guns will be disabled,   
shell ejecting will be shut off, dead bodies will be filtered out,   
pickup and damage flashes will be disabled and explosions will be replaced   
with teleport fx (like TheMod and Qboost4).   
   
"maxfps" will additionally disable light from enemy guns, gibs   
and dynamic light-tables.  
   
"kickroll" will (has to be typed after starting every level), will disable   
weaponkick and view-tilting as well as the walk bobcycle.   
   
"autovars" toggles the fov and viewsize autoset on/off, so that you can play   
with fov 100, viewsize 80, r_drawviewmodel 0 if you want.   
(Malice normally sets these vars automatically, so that you have to alter 
them constantly, which is very annoying. 
  
Spawning bots:  
Before a bot is spawned, skill should be set (0-3)   
If temp1 is 0 (default) bot will use roaming AI.  
If temp1 is > 0, waypoint navigation is enabled  
(waypoint navigation currently supports the maps ddm4 and ztndm3)  
  
"addbot" will spawn a deathmatch opponent.   
   
"addbot2" will spawn a helper bot.   
   
"deathsquad" or "impulse 66" will spawn the vasquez bots.   
   
   
If you want to have the fps-booster vars enabled by default,   
use the samelevel cvar:   
   
- You should edit the supplied autoexec.cfg:   
   
samelevel 0; nothing altered   
or   
samelevel 1; boostfps enabled   
or   
samelevel 2; autovars disabled (default is enabled)   
or   
samelevel 3; boostfps & autovars   
or   
samelevel 5; maxfps enabled   
or   
samelevel 7; autovars & maxfps   
   
(kickroll can't be set with samelevel - it has to be typed in the console)    
   
It you want to play against the bot(s) remember to add the -listen   
parameter to your startup:   
   
Quake -particles 1 -listen -game malice   .... (or something like that)   
   
Then, type "deathmatch 1" in the console and "map ddm1".   
When the level has started, type "addbot".   
(the bots plays all maps, prefers maps without too many lifts and triggers) 
   
Thats it. - enjoy!
