Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
Based upon BG Bot 1.5.

Total overhaul for stability and flexiblity.  All animation and added
axe and lightning.  Planing to add AIRCRAFT and flamethrower.

 Impulse 100 creates a bot. There is no way to
get rid of the bot.  Changing the level will remove all bots so
changing to the current level will destory all bots.

 Impulse 101 lists the current scores of the bots.  Shows up
on all clients.  List the number of bots and the bot with
the highest score.

Nearly all of this code is mine.

Installation
------------

Unzip the files into a directory off QUAKE.  Then run QUAKE using

quake -game bplayer
(assuming you unzipped into the directory BPLAYER.

Then at the consul bind IMPULSE 100 and IMPULSE 101.

For example:
	bind ENTER "IMPULSE 100"
	bind l "IMPULSE 101"
With this every time you press enter you create a bot and when you press
l you list their frags.

TO PLAY DEATHMATCH AGAINST THEM!
--------------------------------

When you play single player, they work WITH you!
If you want to player DeathMatch you have to start quake with the following:

QUAKE -game bplayer -listen 2 +deathmatch 1 +map start

This patch will work with any server normaly.  Remeber, this is a beta and
there WILL be bugs!

NOTE:
There is a (crappy) camera view flicking.  IMPULSE 102 to use.  The only way
to get out is to put in kill at the consul.
