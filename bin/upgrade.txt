*Description of the Modification*
Upgrade Quake adds a new idea to deathmatches by having you kill for better 
weapons.  3 kills earn you the first upgrade, and 3 more for the next.  Your
upgrades stay with you even after you die to make it fair.  HINT : there is
a secret impulse cheat to give you all the weapons.  Press S to see how many 
points you are away from an upgrade ( Example : 2 points // you are 1 point 
away from an upgrade)

*Weapon Descriptions*

Sawed Off Shotgun :
This weapon has no new model, but is 8 times as powerful as a normal shotgun.
Good if that's all you have.

Bounce Bombs:
These bounce around for a while and explode in 3 seconds. They do a good 
amount of damage if they touch anyone. (Good for small rooms).

Double double-barrel Shotguns:
Fires faster and more power, very cool.

Fire Launcher:
This weapons is awesome when used right. It fires fast and conforms to the
walls. Try shooting it at a wall and it will slide along-side it. Shoot at
a corner and the ring will split in 2 and go both ways.  It hardly requires
aiming either.

Lava Nails:
Same as what the Hell Knights shoot.

Derem MT 4:
This is the best Sniper Gun. If your aim is very good, the Derem will take
off a lot of damage, but if you miss slightly then it will fire like a normal
shotgun.  Try using the crosshair by typing CROSSHAIR 1 in the console.

Remote Bomb Launcher:
These will attach to a person or bounce around like a grenade. Fire as many 
as you want since you can have tons attached to someone. Hit D to detonate
all of them. No disarming for these.

Poison Laser:
This weapons fires quick and uses up cells so be careful. A good shot will
but a brightfield around the target. They will be poisoned if they don't find
water, slime, or lava quick! 

Cluster Bombs:
These are powerful beyond belief. You fire 3 grenades, those each explode 
into 2 grenades the fly everywhere. More than once I have been killed by
my own bombs.

DD4:
Taken from the greatest N64 game - Goldeneye! This weapon fires faster than
a shotgun and is more powerful than a double barrel shotgun.

Multi-Rockets:
Fires 3 rockets at once, very powerful.

Capturer:
Set a prison somewhere (such as over lava or a high place), then shoot 
someone 3 times with this. They will be teleported to the prison's location
and dropped.

Homing Lightning:
This weapons has a specific range you have to be in. It only takes 5 cells
and it will split into multiple beams depending on how many people are in
range.

Shield:
This takes 15 cells in all and lasts for about 5 seconds. You cannot be hurt
but you also can't pick up any items.


*Technical Details*
none.


*Know bugs*
If you don't set a prison and try to capture someone, they will be teleported
directly behind them instead of being removed from the game.  If there is
anyone behind them at the moment, they both will be stuck together and unable
to move. Moral : ALWAYS SET A PRISON.
Also for some reason the Remote Bomb Launcher will sometimes stop firing.
If you can't see the bomb, but you can hear it firing, the only cure for 
this is to restart the level (sorry).
The brightfield the Poison Laser makes sometimes stays with a guy after they
are dead.
Don't hit "w" in Single Player Mode. You try and join the White Team, which
kicks you out of the game. It goes past the number of max clients in a Single
Player Game (1).
