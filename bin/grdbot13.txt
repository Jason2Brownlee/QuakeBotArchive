Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

1)	The Guard Bot:

The Guard Bot is the most elaborate enhancement of this patch. Based on Sam Shockey's "decoyz" patch, this one goes several steps further. The Guard Bot is intended to be an all-round bodyguard: it will follow you wherever you go, and it will seek and destroy monsters. For this purpose it is equipped with two different weapons: the Super Nailgun for ordinary attacks and the Vore Missile for dealing with zombies and spawns. It will attack any monster it sees, except for Chthon and Shub-Niggurath (which aren't real monsters anyway) -- it will not attack (other) players however. It can use health boxes and several power-ups to its own advantage. It will shoot triggers if it can find them. It will usually try to follow you around: if you are too far away or too high, it will teleport to your position; it you are too low, it will jump after you; however, you can instruct guards to roam on their own instead of following you.
You can see through a guard's eyes to see what he sees; you can also detonate guards or simply remove them at will. You can also ask for their status at any time (i.e., their health, armour, their distance from you, and whether they are paused/active and following/roaming). Guards can be paused or teleported to you straight away. If you go to the next level any existing guards will be respawned near you after a short delay.

Guards cannot hurt guards, you cannot hurt them (except when a missile or grenade explodes near it); they cannot hurt you. Beware though: a guards' missile may hurt you if it explodes in your vicinity: so keep out if a guard's way if he's targetting spawns or zombies.

And yes, if you go into God mode, so do your guards.

To avoid slowing down the game too much (I only have a 60 MHz Pentium -- yes, you may laugh :-() there is a built-in limit of three Guard Bots for any level.

Apart from which, there is:

2)	General changes:

a)	Monsters will attack each other if provoked.
b)	Crucified zombies can be gibbed.
c)	The head of a gibbed monster will turn into a zombie.
d)	Gibs can be touched, but will hurt at higher skill levels.
e)	At higher skill levels a gib will sometimes turn into a spawn.
f)	Heads can be kicked around, and will explode if you shoot at them.
g)	Monsters can be shoved around: push them off edges etc.
h)	Monsters reel back if hit by a rocket.
i)	At the end of the final level the game can be restarted.

3)	Cheats:

a)	Cheats for Bio Suit, Quad Damage, Pentagram of Protection, Ring of Shadows; these work as toggles, i.e., they last until they're turned off.
b)	Cheats for all weapons & extra ammo.
c)	Cheat for armour (all classes).
d)	Cheat for both keys (silver and gold), works as a toggle.
e)	Cheat for extra health: adds 200 points to your health (999 maximum).
f)	Improved Runecheat (this one really works -- i.e. you get a rune every time you use the cheat).

4)	Extra weapons:

Some weapons have a "double" (or even "triple") that can be selected by pressing the appropriate key again:

a)	Teleport Axe: transports the victim to another position within the level (1).
b)	Proximity Mines Launcher: proximity mines explode if a monster comes within range (6).
c)	Lavaball Launcher: launches a lavaball launcher which fires... well, lavaballs ! They explode like rockets on impact (6).
d)	Homing Missile: this one finds it's own victims (7).
e)	Freezer Laser: freezes your enemy. Beware though, he'll explode if you touch him (8).
f)	Ripper: rips enemies apart with a lightning flash at 25 cells per blast (8).

5)	Extra's:

a)	Light toggle: when activated, you emanate a very bright light. Useful for those very dark corners.
b)	Radar function: reports the four monsters nearest to you, and their health levels.
c)	Turn off weapon view: if you want the complete picture.
d)	View the level from the "intermission" spots, from the "deathmatch spawn" spots or from the "teleport destination" spots: get a camera viewspot from certain (fixed) points within the level. Most levels have at least one "intermission" spot and usually several of the others.
e)	Gravity toggle: toggle gravity between normal (800) and low (100, like in "Ziggurat Vertigo"). Useful for making big leaps.
f)	Megablast: make a big explosion with yourself at the centre (this one won't hurt you). For those tight corners when it all gets too hot to handle.
g)	Home teleport: teleports you to your starting position within the game (well, most of the time anyway).
h)	Observer Mode: transfers the viewpoint to a camera which can be moved around freely in the level.
i)	Teleport Marker: to mark a (safe) spot which you can return to at the press of a key.

6)	Extra monster:

a)	At all levels a hellhound (looks like a dog, but bigger and much tougher, with red eyes) is spawned at a spot close to you. If it dies, a new one will be spawned -- etcetera ad infinitum or until you switch it off.


How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

Simply use any unzipper to install this patch. Unzip in the directory of your choice (e.g., "C:\Games\Quake\GuardBot"), then start Quake with the "-game" parameter: "Quake -game <dir>", where <dir> is the directory where you placed the patch. The "pak0.pak" file contains all files needed to play the patch; the "keys.txt" file describes which key does what.


Technical Details
-----------------

Bugs: sometimes the GuardBot may get stuck, usually after teleporting or spawning. The only way to deal with this is to remove the Bot or teleport it to your own position.
Also: if you look through a guard's eyes, you will not always see the things he is supposed to see (i.e. they remain invisible); this is a technical feature of Quake (entities aren't drawn until a client -- i.e. a player -- actually sees them), not a bug.

So far I haven't encountered any major bugs: BUT: this patch was developed on a stand-alone PC and I haven't had the opportunity to playtest it in Deathmatch or Teamplay :-(
If you do find bugs: please E-mail ! I would appreciate some feedback.
