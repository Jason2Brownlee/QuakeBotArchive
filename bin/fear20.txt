Put together by: Jon (its132@aol.com)

    *To whom it may concern, please file this under quake c compilations*
                       * or conversions, whatever*

  *Also, I'm looking for people to help out with making models and coding,*
                  *so if you're interested, please write*

             *READ THIS ENTIRE FILE BEFORE YOU START WRITING ME!*

|Updates|
*-------*
IN NO PARTICULAR AND A CERTIANLY UNORGANIZED ORDER
SEE THE "FEATURES" SECTION BELOW FOR DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF ALL OF THE STUFF

- Fear.bat added so you can run from the command line w/o typing that whole
  long thing. 
- Client obituary updated to fit new weapons.
- Molotov cocktail flames now only last approx 30 seconds to prevent slag
  on the server and packet overloads (they are still frequent though).
- Backpack bomb and dropped backpack no longer glow.
- Fixed my...umm...hehehe...silly mistake that would broadcast some of yr
  personal information to everyone in the game. Doh.
- Fucked with the models on the laser sight. I like it better.
- New model for the time bomb taken from the Wicked patch.
- Flames from the blaze thrower last longer.
- Shotgun and Super Shotgun randomly jam if continuously fired.
- Regular missiles leave a bubble trail and move slower under water. 
- Increased the firing time for the Sniper Rifle, the Magnum, and Homing
  Missiles, in the name of fair gameplay.
- Decreased the firing time for the Grappling Hook, so it is easier to grapple
  down walls and such.
- Made the bounding box on motion detectors bigger so you can destroy them
  with any weapon.
- Added a model for the jetpack.
- Jetpack now replaces yellow armor at a 1:2 ratio.
- New model for the Magnum taken from Ultimate Quake.
- Added some FEAR graphics.
- More gibs, and gore than you should really want.
- Added a new key system (the solution to the lack of keys problem I was
  talking about in the last version). Check out the section below for all of
  the new key commands. This was a god-sent...too bad there is no god. Hehehe.
- Arrow weapons now update their ammo count.
- Added partial ammo backpack drop.
- Added spells and a whole lot of 'em at that. 
- Added morphing.
- Added water intelligent monsters.
- Added Multiskin Pro.
- Added an ability point system.
- Added an alarm weapon.
- Added a "speak" function.
- In deathmatch you start with 400 health points because with all of the new
  stuff it was too easy to kill someone. 
- Time Bomb does alot more damage.
- Added the gatling gun.
- Cheat command is now "Impulse 132". It gives you 500 ability points as well.
- Radio Tag Bombs stay around forever until you detonate them.
- Feign death uses a different death animation because people would think
  you were crawling when you were feigning death and kinda ruined the point
  of faking yr death in the first place.
- Maximum health is now 150 instead of 100 because the game is a little harder
  now

*------------*
|Installation|
*------------*
 Copy the FEAR20.ZIP file or whatever file name you have (once this is
released the file name is out of my hands and some greasy shareware dealer at
some computer geek convention may decide that DILDO.ZIP is a much better name)
into yr Quake directory. Unzip it using the -d command.

 i.e.
     PKUNZIP FEAR20.ZIP -d

If you don't use the "-d" command it won't put the files in the right
directory and FEAR won't work and then you constantly write me asking why.
It's because you didn't READ THE FUCKING DIRECTIONS.

Now copy the file FEAR.BAT from the FEAR directory into the QUAKE directory.
You can now delete the file from the FEAR directory.

To run FEAR return to the QUAKE directory and type:

     FEAR

|Stuff I just had to say|
*-----------------------*
 Sorry it took so long to get this uploaded. AOL sucks hard as you most likely
already know, but I don't wanna hear any of that "Oh! You use AOL so you must
be an idiot" crap because I coded this patch and you write me about memory
errors so fuck you. This version has actually been finished for about a month
now, but I only just recently got around to putting it on to disk and
uploading at a friend's house. If you are one of the two people that actually
were looking forward to this after I hyped it up for alomst the entire past
month, sorry 'bout the wait. Moving on....
 The .wav file in the beginning is from the Casualties'(NYC PUNK ROCK
CHAOS!!!!) song "For the Punks" off of the way outta print lp POGO ATTACK. 
Considering almost all of you are fat, balding, and think classic rock is
the shit, you won't find this as hip as the three people I know who do, but
I don't care 'cause you're all a bunch of nazi's anyway.
 I had the new monsters, Spider and Manga Babe, in a beta version of Fear 2.0
but I took 'em out 'cause they didn't really fit in with the whole Quake
atmosphere and looked kinda hokey. I'd like to know if you think I should
put them back in or not. If someone could make a cool monster that fits
in with Quake (like if someone could get me the dragon) I'd be more than
happy to put it in. Write me, biatch.
 Sorry, but Fear will not run on an 8mb machine. I know this because it
doesn't work on my computer. I had to use a friend's computer to finish this
and that's why it took so long. I know it works with 16 meg but anywhere in
between is potluck. These stats are if you're running out of DOS, which I
recommend you do. I don't know how much memory it requires to run out of
Windows but my guess is that it is alot. Don't bitch, just run it in DOS.
Sorry you don't get to look at you're pretty Victorian Village wallpaper, but
some folks is lucky and some ain't.
 I lose shit all of the time so I lost a bunch of .txt files so I forgot alot
of the author's names. I didn't take credit for you shit I just wrote that I
didn't do it. If you did something, write me and I'll put yr name in the
.txt file. Don't throw a fit like someone else did.....
 This hasn't been tested in deathmatch so some of this stuff doesn't work
write me.
 Don't buy heroin in New Jersey.

P.S. Check you the patch 'WICKED QUAKE' it's dope as is its author.

|Features|
*--------*
Things in FEAR v2.0 and what they do. The name of creator is listed after the
feature's name. If I created it there is nothing after it. For some of the
features I lost, forgot, or never knew the author's name so I just wrote
something to the affect of "I didn't do it". If you did create it just e-mail
me and I'll give you credit.

* = New addition to v2.0

==> THROWING AXE (Steve Bond wedge@nuc.net) - Well ya see, it's kinda like
    this. It's an axe, and well, you throw it...but this one works.

==> THROWING FLAMING AXE (Howard Roy howard@mortimer.com) - Well ya see, it's
    kinda like this. It's an axe, and well, you throw it, but this time it's
    on FIRE!! You only get one and you must retrieve it use it again, although
    if you don't retrieve it after ten seconds it'll come back to you. Yea, a
    smart axe, I'm supposed to believe that? It'll set whatever it hits on
    fire and then fall to the ground. If something walks over it while it is
    on the ground it'll catch on fire.

==> MORNING STAR (Mike amichael@asu.alasu.edu) - Whatta dumb name, but what
    a great weapon. Tap the fire button and it'll release a morning star at
    an opponent. Push and hold the fire button and it'll pull you to whatever
    it hooked itself onto. Great for getting to out of reach places. It's
    pretty rad when you hook it onto and opponent and pull yrself towards it
    because you can see the pain on their face as the star digs into their
    chest (hard to believe I'm a vegetarian, ain't it?).

==> SNIPER RIFLE (Stalin ???) - This weapon is great for multiple player
    deathmatch games. It uses ten nails per shot but it is definatly worth it.
    I also removed the sound from it because what good sniper uses a rifle
    without a silencer. This way you can sit up in yr sniper's perch and pick
    off enemies without giving away yr position to others by the sound of yr
    weapon.

==> MAGNUM (Don't blame me)- Excessive, but if that's yr thing, whatever.
    Uses 25 shells and blows the fuck out of yr enemies.

==> CROSSBOW (I made the code but the model was made by ?) - This thing is
    pretty cool. It's got pretty good strength. It'll kill a grunt with one
    shot. The thing I like best was how I made it so that the arrows stick in
    the walls and stay there. Uses 2 shells.

==> BOW AND ARROW (Once again I made the code but the models were made by ?)
    See above but with better strength. It's also harder to aim and uses 4
    shells.

==> EXPLODING ARROWS (See above) - Uses the bow and arrow but it now shoots
    gee...exploding arrows? They have a little less power than a missile but
    are cheaper and Rambo uses them so why shouldn't you. 10 shells, biatch.

==> BLAZE GUN (Jonathan Wright nelno@interpath.com) - Hard to say how much
    each shot uses, because you never really just shoot one shot. Uses rockets
    for ammo.

==> RAPID FIREBALL LAUNCHER (Howard Roy howard@mortimer.com)- Shoots fireballs
    rapidly?? Sounds good. Uses two rockets for every shot. The skin for the
    model was taken from the P.A.I.N. patch by Jamie Wood (ghoti@erols.com)

==> LASER (Howard Roy howard@mortimer.com) - This weapon is dope. Shoots out
    laser beams in a speedy manner killing well, ummm, everything. Uses two
    cells.

==>*GATLING GUN (Model by James Lazarus. Model skin by Christopher Bolin. I
    did the code) - Fires a whole mess of bullets...really fast. 

==> RADIO TAG BOMBS (Klaus Breuer sz0759@rzmail.uni-erlangen.de) - The house
    favorite. You can use this weapon in a variety of different ways. Fire a
    bomb and it'll attach itself to whatever it is shot at. Then you have the
    choice to detonate or disarm the bomb. In a Deathmatch match game, tag
    like ten of 'em onto yr opponent and then tell him to give you his
    backpack or you'll blow him up. After he drops his pack and you pick it
    up, blow him up anyway. Oh yea, I colored the stripes on the tag bombs
    yellow so you could tell 'em apart from the grenades.

==> FLAME THROWER (Steve Bond wedge@nuc.net) - This uses rockets and will set
    yr enemies on fire. They can put themselves out by jumping in the water.
    So when they do, throw a stinger in after 'em. Ooops.

==> BLAZE THROWER (Howard Roy howard@mortimer.com)- This is the weapon for
    that pyromaniac that all of us were when we were eight. This just sets
    everything on fire. Enemies, the walls, the floor...you. Be careful, if
    you play with fire, you're gonna get burned.

==> FREEZE THROWER (Howard Roy howard@mortimer.com)- I still haven't found a
    practical use for this except for humilating yr deathmatch opponent, by
    rendering him paralyzed for 15 seconds. Hold down the fire button to
    charge it and then release to fire (or is it freeze?). The longer you
    charge the longer the paralasys (Did I spell that right? Do you care?).
    Uses rockets and the longer it's charged the more rockets it uses. Players
    and monsters are easier to kill when frozen. Uses a max. of 20 rockets.

==> HOMING MISSILE (Iikka Paavolainen ipaavola@cc.hut.fi) - The original patch
    called these "genius" missiles and that's exactly what they are. The best
    homing missile patch around. It'll find something to home in on even if
     the board is all cleared. It goes crazy trying to find something to kill.
    I love it. If by some freak chance it can't find anything after twenty
    seconds it'll self destruct with no damage. Also, if it homes in on
    something and then can't destroy it because it moved behind an obstacle
    it'll send you a message saying "Missile in trouble". Not like it matters
    like you're gonna go rescue it or something. If I could marry a weapon
    this would be it. Uses 2 rockets per shot.

==> GUIDED MISSILE (Ken Alverson kena@tso.cin.ix.net) - These are fun. When
    shot it changes to the view of the actual missile and you get to fly it
    like a plane. I mean, you can use the homing missiles to get around
    corners but you can play games with this. I've sat around just shooting
    these things and seeing how far I can fly them without letting them
    explode. Uses 3 rocket but the strength is not as great.

==> LIGHTNING BALL GUN (Jonathan Wright nelno@interpath.com) - This was
    originally called a BFG 9000 (of Doom fame) but I felt that this was
    inappropriate because the REAL BFG 9000 looked like a toaster oven and
    turned the entire screen green when shot at close range. This looks like
    the lightning gun and shoots a blue ball, certainly not a B(ig)F(uckin')
    G(un). Anyway, when you hit players with this they look like a big giant,
    put his hands around them and squeezed until they popped. Uses 40 cells.
    Fucks a whole lotta shit up.

==> TRACTOR BEAM (Jonathan Avraham procedure@hotmail.com) - Say you're on a
    ledge overlooking a sea of lava staring face to face with an opponent. Hit
    and hold fire to get him in the tractor beam, lift him into the air, drag
    him over the ledge, make him cry for his life...and then drop him.
    It gussles ammo though. Once you hit the fire button the counter on the
    number of cells goes down faster than the number of Grateful Dead fans.
    Doh.

==> STINGER (Pangloss weblok@mmv.se) - Did any of you see the episode of Mr.
    Belvedere, when George dropped the radio into the bathtub and almost died?
    Well, that's what this weapon reminds me of, except there's no fat, yet
    arogant housemaid and whoever's in the water is guaranteed to fry. Whether
    the person in it has 2% or 666% health, if they are in that water, they're
    gonna die. Each stinger uses 25 cells and send electic currents throughout
    the liquid. On this one I colored the stripes blue so they can be
    distinguished from the grenades or tag bombs.

==> TRACER (Jonathan Avraham procedure@hotmail.com) - Shoots out a spiked ball
    that sticks to yr opponent and lets you know when he/she is coming. The
    beeps get louder as it gets closer, but the problem is that it has a
    problem recognizing different levels. You could be in the same place as
    the tracer but three levels up or two levels down and you'll think it's
    right next to you. Still cool, though. Uses 1 rocket and 1 cell.

==> MOTION DETECTOR (Ktgow ktgow@cory.eecs.berkeley.edu) - I love this thing.
    Ok, place one of these on the ground, then run because within 10 seconds
    this thing is gonna be armed. Once it's armed it will shoot nails at
    anything that moves, including it's owner. It'll follow yr motion and
    just keep pumping nails into you. Once out of ammo it can be reloaded,
    but it usually gets the job done the first time. These things can also be
    destroyed if you shoot 'em enough. You need 50 nails to use it.
    
==> DECOYS (Sam Shockey shockesj@concentric.net) - Great for deathmatch.
    This is the most advanced decoy patch that is out there. First fire the
    decoy, it looks like a grenade. Then hit the decoy activator to well,
    activate the decoy. It creates a clone of the player that runs in place
    and when sights an enemy pretends to shoot at it, doing no damage.
    If the enemy does enough damage to or touches the decoy it detonates
    this time doing damage. The decoys can also be remotly detonated by the
    owner, who can also turn them off if close enough. Makes opponents feel
    real stupid when they are shooting at a fake. As long as you have some 
    ability points and some rockets you can make as many decoys as you want.

==> PORTABLE TELEPORTER (W. Harris willh@demonic.demon.co.uk) - I like to use
    this to check up on decoys or traps placed. Once you tell it to memorize
    a location you can teleport back to it at any moment. Memorizing a
    location is free but teleporting there will cost you some ability points.

==> FLARES (Steve Bond wedge@nuc.net) - For those afraid of the dark or for
    those who are pissed off by the dark like yours truly. Once shot, it
    sticks in the wall and lights up the immediate area. It only does 1%
    damage to enemies so it's not worth using as a weapon. Doesn't use any
    ammo, because rockets are a little more powerful than a flare, and that
    just wouldn't be realistic (but then again, is a "scrag" or a "shambler"
    that realistic either?).

==> BACKPACK BOMB (???) - Ok, you know before, when I said that you should put
    alot of tag bombs on yr opponent and then demand their pack in exchange
    for disarming the bombs and then you blow 'em up anyway? Great, well, yr
    opponent read that also, so be prepared. Remember, he's gonna blow you up
    anyway, so blow him up too. Throw a backpack bomb and you both die but
    so what, it's a game, play again. Uses 10 rockets.

==> LIGHT BOMB (Pangloss weblook@mmv.se) - Most players don't like it when
    they can't see, but do you really care about their needs? Drop this and
    in 5 seconds it explodes leaving everything in its radius, rendered blind.
    Now only lasts for 5 seconds because for fairness. Make sure you run
    after you throw it 'cause it'll blind you too.

==>*ALARM (?) - Places an invisible alarm wherever you're standing. When
    anything enters its proximity it lets off this REALLY anoying noise
    and broadcasts a message to you. 

==> DROP BACKPACK (I don't know) - In this section, in the last version, I
    was rambling on and on about how you could use the tag bombs to make a
    player drop his backpack. Then after I released it I realized that I
    forgot to add the drop backpack function. Oh well, you got the damn thing
    for free so why are you complaining? Anyway, this drops yr pack with
    all of yr ammo, read the description of the radio tag bombs to find out
    why this useful, I hate typing.

==> PARTIAL AMMO DROP (Stefan Schwoon ssch0098@rz.uni-hildesheim.de) Drops
    the weapon you currently have selected and some of its ammo in a nice
    and neat backpack <yawn>.

==> PROXIMITY MINES (Ntropy ntropy@voicenet.com) - Attach these to anything...
    floors, walls, ceilings, exploding boxes...anything. After a few seconds
    the mine is armed and when anything comes in the...what?...do you know?..
    yes, that's right, the 'proximity' of the mine, Boom! You can also disarm
    them incase you put 'em on the bathroom door and decided that now you
    really have to go. Uses 4 rockets.

==> TRIP WIRES (W. Harris willh@demonic.demon.co.uk) - Attach one to a wall
    and in two seconds it is activated sending a beam across to the parallel
    wall. If anyone crosses the beam the originating end blows up with the
    impact of a few rockets. Uses 5 rockets and 5 cells and finally makes
    Quake better then Duke Nukem. Make sure you're pressed right up against a
    wall when you place a trip wire or it won't work. 

==> HOVERING NAILBOMB - Shoots out a VERY slow moving spiked ball that HOVERS
    over the ground for about three seconds and then it explodes, shooting
    nails in every direction. It pays to use the crawl function after
    releasing one of these so ya don't get a nail in yr eye. Uses 20 nails,
    biaatch.

==> MOLOTOV COCKTAIL - Hehehehe. KABOOM!! "Help I'm burning, HELP!!". Best 10
    rockets you ever spent.

==> TIME BOMB - A bomb...that's on a timer...so you can run away...next.

==> REMOTE CAMERA - Ohhhhh, this was such a rip off. I just took the guided
    missile patch and changed insignificant things to come up with this.
    Anyway, this fires a small remote controled camera. You control it just
    like you would a guided missile but it is much easier to fly because it
    moves alot slower. Use this to spy on yr opponent, it's very small so
    he probably won't notice it, but be warned that this thing is a piece of
    shit and will fall apart if it touches a player or wall. 

==>*ALARM - (???) Places and invisible alarm on the ground, when anything
    besides yourself comes within it's vicinity it broadcasts a message to
    you and makes a loud, annoying sound that I added. It works when you're
    trying to block off an area or something...

==> FEIGN DEATH (Issaac Lauer gwydion@psu.edu) - Fake death, fake death,
    fake death, ok? I like this for a number of reasons. The first is the
    shock opponents get when they think yr dead and then you stand up and
    set them on fire. Second, because if you have no weapons except for the
    axe, and yr opponent is coming and you really don't feel like dying you
    can feign and pray for the best. It also throws a fake backpack to make
    it look more realistic.

==> CRAWL (This is all original code but I ripped the idea off from Michael
    Gummelt's ducking feature) - Ok, everyone's gotta do me a favor when they
    get this. Turn on the chase cam, run towards a pool of water, jump in the
    air and then hit the crawl button. Now, tell me that is not the fucking
    coolest motherfucking thing you have ever motherfucking saw. Anyway, hit
    the crawl button and you're view is placed to the ground and yr
    animations look as if you're crawling. You'll be much harder to hit
    (grunts and enforcers can't even hit you) but you move noticably slower.
    You won't be able to fit into small places because of the binding box (if
    I set it so you could fit, you would be technically non-existant and no
    one could kill you). You can crawl under a trip wire though. Also, you
    can't use any of the axe weapons (except the morning star [which makes
    you stand up upon use]) or the bow and arrow because it looked really
    weird to see someone planted face down on the ground shooting a bow or
    heaving a axe. I don't know. I don't care.

==> JETPACK (Harlequin dtebben@alumni.caltech.edu) - Adds variety. Jetpacks
    now replace the yellow armor at a 1:2 ratio instead of the biosuits at a
    ratio of 1:1, because, umm, you NEED the biosuits. After getting a
    jetpack, double jump and hold it to release the throttle then use the
    lookup/lookdown/left/right keys to fly. It's rad in deathmatch when you
    and yr opponent both have jetpacks and you take the battle to the skies.
    Homing missiles ruin the fun but, you still got a frag, he he. The jetpack
    uses it's own fuel, when you get one it has enough fuel for approx. 15
    seconds of constant burn (You'll get a message when fuel is low). If you
    kill someone who had a jetpack pick up their pack and you get their fuel.
    It takes some practice to learn how to fly it right, but it's rad after
    you figure it out.

==> CUJO (Jonathan Wright nelno@interpath.com) - Yr very own personal attack
    dog. Command Cujo to stay, follow, attack, or heal. The embarrasing thing
    is that he can kill grunts faster than you can. Let him roam and you'll
    probably find a trail of dead bodies in front of you. You can also switch
    to his point of view or teleport him to yr location. Uses ability points

==> FLASHLIGHT (??? Not me though)- I'm not typing an explanation.

==> LASER SIGHT (Scott Ramsey sramsay@smart.net) - For the sniper in you.
    Places a red dot wherever yr weapon is aimed. But, now if yr weapon is
    aimed at an enemy, secret door, or trigger the dot turns blue. Also, you
    don't get the spotlight with this laser sight. Use the new flashlight
    function for that. Fun, fun, fun.

==> CHASE CAM (Rob Albin albinatr@apci.net) - I don't know what the author
    created this for, I mean I just use it to check out my skins during single
    player games. I'm not saying it's not cool though. It's kinda fun to try
    to play the game outside of the first person perspective, it's kinda like
    a twisted Super Mario Bros. You can select the distance the camera is
    behind you, also.

==>*SPEAK - More of a novelty than anything useful. This just broadcasts an
    insult, threat, whatever. Depending on what skin you are currently using
    it uses a different saying. Try it out.

==>*MORPHING (Jeff Epler jepler@inetnebr.com) - This was THE BIGGEST FUCKING
    PAIN IN THE ASS to code into the patch, but it was definatley worth it.
    Definatley use the chase cam with this, it makes it 1,000,000,000,000
    times cooler. With this you can use ability points (the number depends on
    the monster) to morph into a: zombie, scrag, ogre, hell knight, fiend,
    vore, or a shambler. When using this WEAPON 1 is the melee weapon and
    WEAPON 2 is the fire weapon. Unfortunatly, no on made models for these
    weapons so you gotta just imagine they're there.

==>*SPELLS - Uses yr ability points to cast these spells...

         --> HEALTH GENERATE - Gives you 50 health points
         --> INVISIBILITY - Makes you invisible for 3 minutes
         --> AMPHIBEAN - Breathe underwater for 5 minutes
         --> CIRCLE OF FIRE (I don't remember) - Creates a ring of four flames
             that circle around you.
         --> SOUL SWAP (Jeff Epler) - Trade souls with yr enemy.
         --> ENEMY DISORIENTATE (??) - Makes and enemy confused and they spin
             and jump and all sorts of crazy things.
         --> INFECTION (Got me?) - Infects yr enemy with some crazy New
             Jerseyan disease that slowly takes away their health. THERE IS
             NO CURE.
         --> PARALYZE - Renenders an enemy paralyzed for 45 seconds.
         --> APOCOLYPSE - Kills everything on a level.

==> FALLING DAMAGE (I'll tell you later) - It was kinda ridiculous how
    originally you could be three floors up and jump off and lose only a
    point or two of health. Now it calculates the height you jumped from and
    realistically determines how much health you should loose from a drop like
    that. For those of you who don't like this idea, try this, DON'T JUMP. If
    you have no choice, use the morning star and grapple down. This feature
    makes the tractor beam alot of fun.

==> KICKBACK - Nothing much, just adds realistic "kickback" to the grenade and
    rocket launchers. Oh, boy!

==> EJECTING SHELLS (Steve Bond wedge@nuc.net) - Cool patch that fixes the
    first thing I noticed when I played Quake, that the shotgun didn't expell
    shells like in Doom. This patch added excellent sounds and graphics to
    give you the warm sensation of seeing the yellow and orange cyclinder
    shoot out of the stock of the gun. An update from the KQP gives you
    casings from the nailguns too. You go. Oh, yea if you're playing dm or
    teamplay you can turn off the ejecting shells if the game is moving too
    slow.

==> XSOLDIER (Bill Turner shyft@fwb,gulf.net) - Gives grunts random weapons.
    Some grunts now shoot super shotguns. Grunts using the regular shotgun
    have a single grenade. Some grunts use a nailgun. Some grunts use the
    flamethrower and grunt backpacks now give more realistic ammo. This patch
    makes single player or DM with monsters MUCH harder, but I updated yr
    weapons why shouldn't I update theirs. It's all about equality. Also,
    whoever decided to call them "grunts" is a sad fucker indeed.

==>*WATER INTELLIGENT MONSTERS (Kyle Hoffman rhofmann@crl.com) - Monsters
    are now aware of water. They can swim and they can also drown.

==> NEW ANIMATIONS - Well, they're not exactly new. Ya see, iD had a few
    animations that they created but never implemented into the game, so I
    did. Now ogres restart their chainsaws after they smash you with it and
    grunts with nailguns stop and reload their guns in between rounds. Aside
    from the asthetic value, this has another purpose. The nailguns were just
    too unfair. If you didn't shoot them before they saw you, you were as good
    as dead. Now they have to stop and reload. La, la, la.

==> GIBBABLE CORPSES (?) - Now you can fuck people up after they're already
    dead. Tag bombs on the corpse or wack 'em with the axe and just watch the 
    meat go flying. I also fixed it so in deathmatch if you're killed and
    then gibbed and yr opponent then picks up yr head, it's like he's
    carrying it around and you can still see. Nothing productive, just
    amusing. Respawn to get yr head back.

==>*MORE GORE - Ummm....more gore?

==> FOOTSTEP SOUNDS (Brett Wagner ??)- Yup, they're footsteps alright.

==> LIVING WALL ZOMBIES (I don't know) - Zombies that once were just flopping
    around on the wall can now jump off the wall and can be gibbed. I hate
    that noise when they rip off their skin and throw it at you...Ewww....

==> GIBBABLE BACKPACKS (I don't care) - Backpacks explode when shot at. If
    there were grenades in the backpack...Boom!

==> TELEPORTING ROUNDS (?) - Now yr projectile will go through a teleporter
    instead of blowing up when it hits one...just what you've always wanted.

==> RICOCHET NAILS (Do you care?) - Nails randomly ricochet off walls. Wow.

==>*ABILITY POINTS - Everytime you kill a monster or player you get a certain
    amount of ability points. The number of ability points you get depends on
    the monster (higher difficulty monsters obivously give more ability
    points). These can be use to cast spells, morph into monsters, summon
    Cujo, activate a decoy, or teleport. 

==>*REALISTIC WEAPONS (Cameron Newham cam@iinet.com.au) - All right, this
    isn't all of this patch, I just took what I like out of it. Call me a
    fascist but you all probably like that band 'Rush' anyway, so I don't
    care. The regular and double barrelled shotguns randomly jam if they are
    continuously fired. When regular missiles are fired under water they
    move slower and leave a trail of bubbles behind 'em. I had problems
    getting this to work with the homing and guided missiles, so guess what?
    THIS ONLY HAPPENS WITH THE REGULAR MISSILES!

==> MULTIPLAYER VARIATIONS (Walter Lord lord@brodart.com) - Teamplay -1 is a
    game of tag and Deathmatch 3 is a game of deathmatch with monsters. Key
    binded to makes it easy to run this patch on a server with up to four
    teams of four. Then again, since I don't have a network I don't even know
    if this works. Could be fucked for all I know, but I don't think so
    'cause the other non-multiplay functions work.

==> GRUNT MULTISKINS (Bill Turner http://www.fwb.gulf.net/~shyft/) - I was
    really getting sick of play testing this fucking mod over and over and
    over and seeing those same grunts over and over and over again. So now
    they have different skins. Five in all. All just as ugly as the original.

==>*MULTISKINS PRO (???)- Changes yr skin like the old version of Multiskin,
    but now when you pick up the biosuit you actually change into the biosuit.
    You change back to the skin you had when you picked up the biosuit when
    it runs out. Players now also have matching head gibs and the selected
    skin stays on the body after the player is killed and respawns. I didn't
    make any of these skins, but I made a bunch of the head gibs so that's
    why they're kinda shitty...

*----------*
|Known Bugs|
*----------*
-Crabs, lice, scabies and "PACKET OVERLOADS" are frequent in Fear. This is
 no big deal and you should pretty much just ignore it. 
-Sometimes the light bomb leaves the screen white if you quit or respawn while
 you're still blinded. If this happens go to the last line in the CONFIG.CFG
 file and change the gamma to "1".
-Once in awhile a grunt's corpse won't be gibbale. This happened after I added
 the XSOLDIER patch, but I'm stumped on why because 99 times out of a 100 the
 corpse will be gibbable but there's that one time that it won't, oh fuck it.
-If you have GOD mode on and throw a stinger in water that you are currently
 in, it gives you Quad Damage. I have no fucking clue why this happens...
-Picking you a biosuit while you're under the charm of the amphibean spell,
 makes things go screwy so just don't do it.
-Don't shoot a guided missile if you still having homing missiles out because
 they try to home in on yr guided missile and causes the game to crash.
