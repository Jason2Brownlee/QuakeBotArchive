I modified the tmbot qc mod to shoot grenades at zombies.
I cannot take much credit for this mod because i am not really a good 
proggrammer and the bot is mostly Micheal Polucha's (mpolucha@earthlink.net)
code.
the shotgun shells code was by steve bond (Email: wedge@nuc.net)
Much credit to them!

*****INSTRUCTIONS*****
To play deathmatch against the bot, 
while the demo is playing, bring down the console (~),
then type DEATHMATCH 1
then type MAP "MAPNAME"    (eg: e1m2)
the e1 represents the episode 1
and m2 represents the  second mission 
THE BOT ACTIVATES AUTOMATICALLY AND RESPAWNS IN THE PLAYER SPOTS
WHEN IT IS KILLED
THE BOT NOW USES IMPULSES AS SAID IN THE TMBOT11.TXT FILE!!


Personnally added new features since my first mod.
1. The bot goes into pain a lot less often

2. sending the bot into deatchmatch mode makes the bot target !any! player. Even you!
	(see how tough your bot really is)
3. the bot kills zombies by using a grenade launcher
4. even more deadly laser
5. If the bot is attacking a target and is hit by 
another target then the bot attacks the new attacker
(phew)
6. The bot is three times stronger!
7. you and the soldier eject shotgun shells while using
the shotgun.
8. The bot fires more, and faster
9. in single player mode, the bot appears in the 1 player start point, so move before you activate him!
10 . in deathmatch  the bot will appear in player start points and will attack you on sight!
(automatically goes into deathmatch mode)
11. multiple bots allowed!
12 . bot can pick up health and armour
13.bot searches for health while no enemys targeted
14. moves WHILE FIRING!


Check tmbot.txt for more important info!
