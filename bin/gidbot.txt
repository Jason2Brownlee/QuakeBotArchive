Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

This QuakeC patch is an AI bot for Quake.
Commands include:
-----------------
	IMPULSE 205 - add a bot (can do it repeatedly)
	IMPULSE 208 - add four bots
        IMPULSE 210 - scoring
        IMPULSE 212 - turn on observer mode
        IMPULSE 213 - turn off observer mode
	IMPULSE 214 - update bots. Use when the 
			SV_GRAVITY or SV_MAXSPEED 
                        server varibles are changed.
	IMPULSE 215 - turn on verbose mode 
        IMPULSE 216 - turn off verbose mode
	IMPULSE 220 - Normal scores (frags)
        IMPULSE 1XX - Sets the ratio of 1 bot per human player (as players leave so do bots)
        SKILL N - Change skill level (N = 0 to 3, default
			is 1)
                
Features Include:

* 4 skill levels (0 to 3), which affect
	- bot accuracy when shooting 
        - speed that it can follow or "track" you
	- bot reaction time, and time taken to respond to "pain"
        - which weapons it will use to attack you
* Uses all player frames (Checked with Quake ME)
* Improved following AI 
        - can now handle following opponents around corners by analysing
          player actions, as well as using doors and teleporters
* Ability to learn levels
        - Bots use their experience to remember where power ups are and to 
          allow it to roam around, hunt opponents, etc. All knowledge is built
          upon the bot internal map
* Understands jumping
        - won't jump into lava or slime 
        - will jump up onto ledges if its designated "goal" requires it
        - may use rocket jump if necessary, although it will not use it
          if it can reach the area with a normal jump
* Combat AI
        - the bot will attack differently dependig upon the bot's current 
          armoury, its opponent's weapon, the distance between them, and
          whether enemy is running away.
        - picks best weapon depending on range 
        - will go after health, ammo, or a weapon in the middle of combat!
          (should the circumstance require it)
        - trys to avoid combat if health or ammo low, and it thinks it can
          escape        
	- avoids combat with players who are invincible
        - "remembers" players accuracy, tactics and adds it to its AI. This
          means that this is one of a limited few bots which have a learning
          curve. "Forgets" tactics after game restarts otherwise bot would
          become too powerful
        - will prey upon weaker targets. If it can choose between fragging
          a player or causing damage to a more powerful target, it will
          choose the weaker bot in order to score a frag
        - can learn player "hatred" i.e. it can remember who fragged it and
          will hunt them if the bot's armoury appears to be larger than its
          opponent
* Improved grenade and rocket aiming
* Understands triggers and buttons
	- Will go for the triggered object when it shoots a trigger 
          or presses a button. (This is how it can find secrets)
        - Doesn't go after doors, unless it is open or has been triggered by
          the bot
        - Doesn't go after triggers or buttons which have already been
          activated, although it may steal secrets if it can reach them
          before the player.
* Understands doors, teleporters, secret doors
        - Will fire at secret doors to trigger them
* Chooses goals according to priorities depending on its current power 
        - Understands and uses all weapons, ammo, powerups, etc.
	- Won't keep going after an item if it can't reach it
        - Will use internal map to go after items it wants but can't see
* Up to 16 bots on a level
* Multiplayer Server capability
        - deathmatch bots vs humans!
  	- No other files needed by the clients 
          (they can use their original progs.dat).
* Scoring
        - Impulse 210 gives scores
	- scoring is 2 * kills - deaths - 2 * suicides
* Observer mode. Impulse 212 turns on, Impulse 213 turns off.
* Bot swims in water
        - doesn't usually drown, unless forced and held underwater by player
          fire
	- understands whether it can swim to items
	- can jump out of water
        - follows enemies into water
	- won't use lightning gun underwater unless the bot is
          invincible
* Same number of bots generated in new level after players exit via slipgate
* Bots die in lava and slime, and drown if under water too long
* Bots can telefrag or be telefragged

* Known Bugs
  None (As I'm aware, if you find any please contact me.)

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

Unzip the file to a folder called Gideon in your Quake directory 
(e.g. C:\Quake\Gideon).
The zip file will not create any folders, you need to do it.
To play, type QUAKE -GAME GIDEON -LISTEN 16 from the Quake directory.  This 
modification only works with the registered version of Quake. Make sure you 
run deathmatch when you play with the bots-they don't play coop (either 
select multi-player,or type DEATHMATCH N at the console, where N = 1 or 
2).  To change skill levels, type SKILL N at the console, where N is an 
integer 0 to 3.
