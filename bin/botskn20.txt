                BGbot Code is used as base-now really mangled
                Not much left of it now...

                Looked at Multiskin code to figure out how to do skins
                no code used anymore- but thanks for showing the world!

Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
Originally a BGBot(1.6) hack,  this little
project started with the inclusion of
skins to help distinguish between the bots.
Now includes improved combat ai, fixed attack
code, all the death animations, bodies that
stay and MORE! Just added: Teamplay! Make a
team of bots and go head to head with your
HelperBots!

Info on the Project
-------------------
Just recently,  I managed to really destroy some
of the code,  so i had to go back to an older version
(backups,  backups)... so if something is broken again,
tell me and I'll fix it.

WHAT! NO SOURCE CODE??!!  To simplify things
for all the newbies out there, I'll be releasing
just the compiled source.  Don't worry, you
QuakeC programmers out there, the source is
NOT being withheld.  It's available on the
BOTSKIN HOMEPAGE(see bottom) and ME!! through
e-mail.  Just ask.  All I'd like is a little
recognition.

BTW,  it seems that lately, my typing has become
quite atrocious so if something doesn't work,
something looks wrong in this doc, IT PROBABLY
IS.  (and I'd be really grateful if you pointed
it out for me)

This has been a little doodling project when
I'm not doing homework to learn C. Now 
that I have 20 megs of ram,  I can't really 
say whether it runs on 8 megs anymore so
feedback would be appreciated!
BTW, check out the TANGMASTA's VBOT!
"Help me!  Don't shoot!"
and the QCannon!
"Wow.  Never noticed a rocket launcher there
before..."

New in Version 2.0!
-------------------
-unimportant: # of bots running printed when
        new bots created
-should now use ALL POWERUPS!
-attempts to check for lava before jumping...
-strafing code is in...time for new tactics
-bots will now strafe (at cl_sidespeed)
-bots yaw at whatever speed in cl_yawspeed
-bots now run at whatever speed in cl_forwardspeed

New in Version 1.9
------------------
-Fix for teamplay:  you lose a frag for telefragging a teammate
-Partial Fix - EDICT overload crash.  The bots now wait a
        random time before coming back in...like players
        instead of instantaneous respawn...so go for broke.
	I can get around 80 or so without crashing
	(but don't ask about playability)
-Added fix for counting number of swimming monsters from 1.06a
-New skin: the COWBOY!
-Sorry Adam VARN (see below for incorrect spelling)

New in Version 1.8
------------------
-THANK YOU ADAM VARNE... The Impulses were STILL wrong...
        the CORRECT impulses should go from 100-103
        Sorry to all those who just couldn't get this patch
        to work.


Impulses
--------

 Impulse 100    creates 1 bot (for BOTS' Team in Teamplay)
 Impulse 101    creates 1 bot - HelperBot for Your Team
                in Teamplay
 Impulse 102    prints scores to console
                (hit the ~ to bring it down)
                (scroll using pgup pgdn if it is offscreen)
                (also printed to console on player death)
 Impulse 103    Destroys ALL the bots

 Impulse 200    goes through skins forwards
 Impulse 201    goes through skins backwards

To Deathmatch: Goto multiplayer.  Start a NEW GAME (any type)
        and make sure the play type Deathmatch.  That's it!
To Activate Teamplay: Set up as Dmatch but simply select
        Teamplay ON when selecting options. 
To Set Skill Level of Bots:  Simply change the skill level
        in the menu.

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
***Option 1) The Easy Way
Make a new dir in your quake directory. (ie c:\quake\botskin)
then unzip botskinXX.zip with -d option 

(ie pkunzip -d botskinXX.zip).  

It should automatically create the necessary directories. 

(ie quake -game botskin)

***Option 2) The Hard Way
Make a new dir in your quake directory. (ie c:\quake\botskin)
then move this progs.dat into that directory and copy your
*.cfg from c:\quake\id1 into the same directory. Make a subdir
called "progs" and move the player.mdl file in there

***After install - If you d/l src.zip (the source code)
Make a new subdir for the source code (ie c:\quake\botskin\src).
Unzip src.zip to that directory.  The source code MUST be compiled 
to be used.  A zipped copy of QCC (QuakeC Compiler) should be 
available on my homepage. Place the compiled progs.dat in the 
main botskin directory (ie c:\quake\botskin\progs.dat)

Then from the c:\quake dir. type:
        quake -game botskin

Bind a key to impulse 100, impulse 101, impulse 102,
impulse 200 and impulse 201 if you want easy access
to them.

From the console type:
        bind KEYHERE "impulse 100"
        bind KEYHERE "impulse 101"
        bind KEYHERE "impulse 102"
        bind KEYHERE "impulse 103"
        bind KEYHERE "impulse 200"
        bind KEYHERE "impulse 201"

Replace KEYHERE with any key you're not using.
