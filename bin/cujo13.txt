บ  Description of the Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

This mod creates a personal attack dog which will follow the
player and attack his enemies.

There are three new weapons in the mod:  a laser blaster, selectable by
selecting the shotgun twice, the blaze gun which replaces the normal nailgun,
and the BFG, selectable by selecting the Thunderbolt twice.  Picking up
a Thunderbolt automatically gives the player the BFG along with the
Thunderbolt.  For more info about these weapons, especially the BFG-9000,
see the separate text files BLAZEGUN.TXT and BFG-9000.TXT.

บ  How to use Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

Impulse 100  Activates and Deactivates the dog

Impulse 101  Pretty cool but you really shouldn't use it as Quake would get
             really boring really fast.  I put it in to make Cujo debugging
             easier.  Just try it.

Impulse 102  Tell Cujo to stay or follow.  When staying, Cujo will stand
             where he is until he sights an enemy or he is told to follow.
             If Cujo sights an enemy, he will automatically leave stay mode
             and return to the player after killing all targets (if he can).
             Thanks to NAME HERE for suggesting this!

Impulse 103  This toggles your screen between the player's viewpoint and Cujo's
             viewpoint.  This looks a bit odd at first, because Cujo's yaw
             (turn) rate is very high (normally in 30 degree increments).  I
             turned this down to 20 degrees and it looks pretty decent, but
             it's still not as smooth as the player view.  When you use this
             view, your player is still vulnerable, so don't get distracted
             for too long.

Impulse 104  Teleport the dog to your location.

Impulse 105  Turns on Cujo's collar lamp.  Great for dark places.

Impulse 106  Reports on Cujo's status.  If Cujo is not visible to the player
             then his status cannot be determined.

Impulse 107  Toggles Cujo between attack and non-attack modes.

Bind these impulses to keys to make commanding Cujo easy.  For example, to
make the Q key activate and deactivate Cujo put this line in your
config.cfg file (or type it in the Quake console):

BIND Q "IMPULSE 100"

Now, every time you press Q Cujo will be toggled between his active and
inactive state.  You can bind the other two impulses in a similar manner.

บ  How to Install the Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

Cujo no longer comes with it's own installation batch file.  To install
Cujo 1.3, make a directory in your Quake directory called CUJO.  Unzip
CUJO13.ZIP into that directory using PKUNZIP's -d option.  For instance:

PKUNZIP -d C:\DOWNLOAD\CUJO13.ZIP

If you do not use the -d option the mod will not work correctly, if at all.
If you are using WinZip, it is normally set to do this automatically.

To start Quake using the Cujo mod, go to your quake directory and type:

QUAKE -GAME CUJO

where CUJO is the directory where you unzipped the CUJO13.ZIP archive.  See
the above section about impulses and binding keys to learn how to control
Cujo once you're playing Quake.

If you are interested in seeing how Cujo was made, you can manually
unzip the file SOURCE.ZIP which was contained inside CUJO13.ZIP
and look at the modified source.  If you would like to make your
own Quake C mods, get QCC.ZIP and read the instructions contained
within it.  Also, find one of the many web pages with info about
Quake modifications to learn more.

บ  Technical Details  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออผ

Features:

New features in version 1.3:

 The grappling hook is available (only by selecting the axe twice - no
  separate impulse).

 Cujo can now be hit by all of his owner's weapons fire, including the axe.
  So, for Cujo's sake, aim carefully.

 Cujo can activate and use platforms.

 Cujo can follow the player by jumping across water and from ledge to ledge.
  He gets lost a _lot_ less now.

 Cujo can follow the player into water.

 Cujo will jump into water if he becomes engulfed in flames.

 Cujo can now be activated in and under water.

 Cujo knows when to jump across water or gaps to attack an enemy.

 Both player corpses and Cujo corpses are solid and gibbable.

 A BFG-9000 that works *just like* (see BFG-9000.TXT) the original big-daddy
  in Doom.

 The Blaze Gun which can light enemies and bodies on fire.

 Fire that can spread from one enemy to another -- don't get too close to
  that burning body, or you might be next!

 An enforcer's blaster.

Features carried over from version 1.2c:

 Cujo can draw enemy fire, lessening the amount of damage the player takes.

 Seeks out monsters or other players and attacks them.

 Will continue to attack as long as an enemy target is visible.

 Will not attack teammates under Teamplay rules.

 Cujo can follow the player through portals.

 Cujo will not activate trigger fields (such as light triggers and traps)

 Cujo is trained *not* to attack zombies, allowing you to toss a grenade
  in there without blowing up your dog in the process.  (But he will
  sometimes lick their gibs when your done - hey, dogs will be dogs!)

 Cujo is a special, genetically enhanced breed of Rottweiler with 8 times
  the endurance of other dogs his size.  He can cause up to twice as much
  damage per attack as his piddly cousins, too.  And to top it all off,
  Cujo is wearing a special suit of armor designed specifically with him
  in mind.  Cujo is one *bad* dog.

 Cujo is equipped with a special device based on slipgate technology.
  Should he become separated from you, you can teleport him to your own
  location instantly.  Cujo is even smart enough to activate this device
  on his own when the distance becomes very great.

 Cujo does not need to be fed.  He takes care of this himself.

 Cujo just loves to tackle big Shamblers while you put the nails to 'em!

 This is not Sea Quest, so no amount of technology will allow you to talk
  to an animal.  He just growls and barks like animals do.


Bugs:

 None so far (yeah, right).

 Please email about any bugs you find!

บ  Future Enhancements  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออผ

 Cujo currently can jump across (over) and down, but not up to a higher
  ledge.  This should be fixed in the next minor update, I just didn't
  get around to it.

 Make Cujo go after a teleporter that his owner just went through.
  Currently he handles teleporters okay, but doesn't knowingly try to
  follow his owner through them.

 Decrease the time between frames for Cujo, most especially pain frames,
  so that he will be less vulnerable to player attacks in deathmatch.

 Cujo still cannot move across broken floors very well, such as those in
  the episode 3 entrance on the start level.  This is due largely to Quake's
  internal movetogoal () function, and unless I write a replacement, I doubt
  this problem will go away.

บ  Revision History  บ
ศออออออออออออออออออออผ


Changes in version 1.3

 Major following/attacking AI enhancements.

 Streamlined target acquisition code, now twice as fast.

 Fixed lots and lots of minor bugs:

  Cujo no longer teleports to the owner during the intermission view.

  Cujo always goes after the closest enemy/food in his view.  If another
  was closer but not visible to Cujo, he still goes after the one he saw
  first.

  Fixed "tried to sprint to a non-client" message.

  Cujo no longer eats gibs during deathmatches unless he is hurt.

  Cujo no longer tries to eat "phantom-gibs".  This problem has been
  ruthlessly tracked down and crushed :)

  Cujo's body was not always being removed correctly.

  Probably a lot more than these that I can remember.

  Cujo doesn't "stand up" for a frame after dying, as he would sometimes
  do before.

 Cujo's body is now copied to the bodyque (yeah, I know, it's queue) along
  with the player bodies.

 Lots of other stuff I forgot to write down.


Changes in version 1.2c

 Fixed some bugs with Cujo in deathmatch:

    Cujo was not being removed when his owner died.

    If the owner died while in Cujo's view he was stuck.

    KILLing oneself did not remove Cujo (this bug was not actually related
    to being killed).

 Fixed INSTALL.BAT and CUJO12B.BAT.  CUJO12B.BAT would actually try to run
  from the directory QUAKE\CUJO12A, causing an error if version 1.2a was not
  installed, and running the older version if it was installed, thus it might
  appear that there were no changes.

Changes in version 1.2b

 Fixed the bug which was screwing up the players vectors and causing some
  of the weapons to malfunction -- most notably the lightning gun would
  not follow the player when he turned!

 Fixed bug that allowed weapon changing while seeing from Cujo's point of
  view.  This was reseting the weapon model and making it look as if Cujo
  was carrying a weapon.  You can change weapons and even shoot while seeing
  from Cujo's viewpoint, but the weapon model will not be displayed as if
  Cujo were holding it.

Changes in version 1.2a

 Impulse 103 - toggle to and from Cujo's viewpoint is now working correctly
  (it was purposely disabled in version 1.2).

 Cujo runs a bit smoother because he is updated more frequently and his yaw
  rate is 20 degrees instead of 30 (which is the turn rate of normal dogs).

Changes in version 1.2

 Cujo will eat gibs and heads for health.  Eating either will heal him 15
  points.  If there are no enemies around and Cujo's health is 90% or less
  he will eat any gibs he sees.  If Cujo's health is 25% or less he will
  go after any visible gibs even if enemies are visible to him.  Cujo will
  not go after gibs if he has been told not to attack.  Thanks to Gary 
  Mcmillin" <psyhe@hitech.net.au> for this idea!

 New rules for Cujo in a deathmatch:
  1) You must pick up a yellow armor to get Cujo.  You will still get the
     yellow armor, but Cujo will be made available to you for ONE USE.  If
     you don't need the armor because yours is better or the same IT STILL
     GETS PICKED UP.  This is to prevent the Cujo powerup from staying around
     for other people to pick up.  If your armor is better, you will still
     keep the better armor, but the armor powerup will disappear.
  2) You can only spawn one Cujo at a time.
  3) You can only keep one Cujo powerup at a time.  You CAN spawn a Cujo
     and then pick up another Cujo powerup, but if you pick up a second
     powerup, you will still only have one other use.  There is no counter
     for how many Cujo powerups you can have.  You either have one or you
     don't!
  4) Instead of 200 health and 200 red armor, Cujo gets 100 health and
     150 yellow armor in deathmatch.

 Cujo has a a refined skin, thanks to Ed Oviedo <joviedo@gibson.com>, who
  smoothed it out with Photoshop.  Thanks, Ed.

 Cujo no longer teleports away when he is killed.  Either he get's gibbed,
  or his body remains where it falls.  Much cooler.  The bodies stay around
  for a few minutes.  Don't ask me to make all bodies solid.  I tried this
  and it sucks.  They just get in the way.

 You can find out Cujo's health and armor status as long as he is in view
  of the player.

 You can tell Cujo to stay or follow.  If Cujo is staying he will still
  attack enemies, but he will not follow the player.  Thanks to Betty Hardy
  <bhardy@idcnet.com> for giving me the idea.

Changes in version 1.1

 Cujo now *looks* like a Saint Bernard!  Okay, he looks like a white
  rottweiler with brown spots.  The dog skin doesn't seem to map quite
  as regularly as the player skin (the dog skin is drawn at a weird angle)
  so a 3 of the triangles that make up the dog were mapping wierdly and
  I couldn't seem to change them completely.  Also, St. Bernards have
  floppy ears and long tails, but Cujo doesn't, cause he's still made
  from a rottweiler model.  If you think the new skin sucks, let me know,
  because I'm not completely satisfied with it.  Your feedback will be
  appreciated.

 fixed the absence of \n's (returns) after some of Cujo's barks and
  growls

 Cujo now spawns to the right of the player if possible and will not
  activate at all if there is no room around the player

 Cujo can now be told to break off an attack, or not to attack at all.
  This makes it a lot easier to avoid killing him when you want to
  punch a rocket into what he's attacking.

 Messages concerning Cujo's activation, deactivation and death now
  all appear in the center of the screen, while Cujo's comments appear
  at the top left. (Cujo also whines when he want's to attack and you
  won't let him...)

Changes in version 1.0

 What changes?  This was the first one.
