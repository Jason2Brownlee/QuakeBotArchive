Assembled comments from GG, to tell what these files are:

You can grab a Linux .tar.gz version of Battlemech and
the new windows binaries with these files, download
both. A new mainmenu is also included in the .zip
file. "Single Player" is greyed out now to indicate
that there is no single player available yet and it's
no longer "Help / Ordering" but only "Help". Check it
out.
The Linux version has only a pak0.pak but is version
1.1. I glued them together to make it smaller.

NOTE:
The new basedir is now called "base", so make sure to
rename the "Id1" folder to "base"!

In the multiplayer menu you now can chose between
Deathmatch and Rambo match.
I added a autoexec.cfg file. The only thing I changed
is a line that sets the maxplayers cvar to 4 to save
some ressources in some engines (that was usefull for
Darkplaces until yesterday. LH changed the code so
it's no longer requiered but usefull).


Wazat's note:
bmechstuff.zip does not appear to have any folders in
it.  This means you'll have to move the files yourself.
:(

Here's where they go:
The two battlemech .exe files go in the BattleMech
folder, as do the two dlls.  autoexec.cfg goes in
the newly renamed "base" folder.  mainmenu.lmp and
menuplyr.lmp go in the base/gfx folder.

Hope this info is correct.  <:)
