บ  Description of the Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

This mod creates a personal attack dog which will follow the
player and attack his enemies, even drawing fire in the process.

The dog will not attack zombies, since it cannot gib them.

This bot is based on original dog code and some code from
DM Bot 1.0.  The dog does not have any manual control functions
like those bots do.  He's all auto or he's dead.

บ  How to use Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

Impulse 100  Activates and Deactivates the dog

Impulse 104  Teleport the dog to your location.

Impulse 105  Turns on Cujo's collar lamp.  Great for dark places.

Impulse 107  Toggles Cujo between attack and non-attack modes.

Bind these impulses to keys to make commanding Cujo easy.  For example, to
make the Q key activate and deactivate Cujo put this line in your
config.cfg file (or type it in the Quake console):

BIND Q "IMPULSE 100"

Now, every time you press Q Cujo will be toggled between his active and
inactive state.  You can bind the other two impulses in a similar manner.

บ  How to Install the Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ


Unzip CUJO10.ZIP into a temporary directory and run INSTALL.BAT
with the full path of your Quake directory.  For example, if Quake
is located in C:\GAMES\QUAKE then you would type:

INSTALL C:\GAMES\QUAKE

This will install the necessary files in a directory called CUJO
which is inside of your Quake directory, and also create a batch
file in the Quake directory called CUJO.BAT which will run the
modified version of Quake.

If you are interested in seeing how this was done, you can manually
unzip the file SOURCE.ZIP which was contained inside CUJO10.ZIP
and look at the modified source.  If you would like to make your
own Quake C mods, get QCC.ZIP and read the instructions contained
within it.  Also, find one of the many web pages with info about
Quake modifications to learn more.

บ  Technical Details  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออผ

Features:

 Cujo can draw enemy fire, lessening the amount of damage the player takes.

 Seeks out monsters or other players and attacks them.

 Will continue to attack as long as an enemy target is visible.

 Will not attack teammates under Teamplay rules.

 Cujo can follow the player through portals.

 Cujo will not activate trigger fields (such as light triggers and traps)

 Cujo is trained *not* to attack zombies, allowing you to toss a grenade
  in there without blowing up your dog in the process.  (But he will
  sometimes lick their gibs when your done - hey, dogs will be dogs!)

 Cujo is a special, genetically enhanced breed of Rottweiler with 8 times
  the endurance of other dogs his size.  He can cause up to twice as much
  damage per attack as his piddly cousins, too.  And to top it all off,
  Cujo is wearing a special suit of armor designed specifically with him
  in mind.  Cujo is one *bad* dog.

 Cujo cannot be injured by your shotgun blasts, axe, or thunderbolts, but
  you can hurt him with nailguns and rockets, so keep this in mind when
  firing at an enemy your faithful companion is already tearing to pieces.

 Cujo is equipped with a special device based on slipgate technology.
  Should he become separated from you, you can teleport him to your own
  location instantly.  Cujo is even smart enough to activate this device
  on his own when the distance becomes very great.

 Cujo does not need to be fed.  He takes care of this himself.

 Cujo just loves to tackle big Shamblers while you put the nails to 'em!

 This is not Sea Quest, so no amount of technology will allow you to talk
  to an animal.  He jsut growls and barks like animals do.


Bugs:

 Cujo does not jump or walk past edges unless he is attacking, at which

  point he can fall into water and become lost (I hope to find a way to
  fix this...)

 Cujo sometimes gets lost.  Okay.  Maybe it happens pretty often.

 Cujo is not deactivated after a level change, I don't think, but I think
  the Quake code will dispose of it's entity memory anyway (tell me if I'm
  wrong, please).

 Sometimes Cujo will continue trying to attack an enemy, even when he
  can't see it.  I put code in there to prevent this, and it seems not
  to happen very often, so I'm wondering if it is a problem with the
  visible () function.  I haven't really checked into it, since it is
  rare, and teleporting him to you will fix the problem, as will finding
  and killing the enemy he's after.

 Cujo's head *will not throw*!  This one's got me baffled for now, so
  I've just left it like it is.  Gibs are thrown quite nicely, but no
  head.  It may be a problem with h_cujo.mdl, but I haven't looked into
  it yet.

 Please email about any other bugs!

บ  Future Enhancements  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออผ

Version 1.1

Cujo will eventually be able to pick up health (and maybe armor, a dog being
able to do anything with either is just about equally stupid, so I may as
well).

He still needs ai enhancments, but I haven't even begun to work on this
yet.

Version 1.0

I'm not satisfied with the ai following routines as they are, but I have
to learn more about what functions are available to Quake C for determining
world status such as platform edges and so on before I can do more on this.

I think it would be great to add Cujo as a power up.  This should have been
part of the game.  It would even work well in DeathMatch, as Cujo would
be an expendable weapon which worked in addition to the one you were already
using.  No time limit for this powerup, he stays around as until he's
killed.  At some point I hope to make Cujo a powerup which could be placed
on levels.  This would mean disabling some player control such as activating
and deactivating the dog when the player hasn't found the powerup.  If
you're interested in doing this, let me know!

บ  Revision History  บ
ศออออออออออออออออออออผ


Changes in version 1.1

 Cujo now *looks* like a Saint Bernard!  Okay, he looks like a white
  rottweiler with brown spots.  The dog skin doesn't seem to map quite
  as regularly as the player skin (the dog skin is drawn at a weird angle)
  so a 3 of the triangles that make up the dog were mapping wierdly and
  I couldn't seem to change them completely.  Also, St. Bernards have
  floppy ears and long tails, but Cujo doesn't, cause he's still made
  from a rottweiler model.  If you think the new skin sucks, let me know,
  because I'm not completely satisfied with it.  Your feedback will be
  appreciated.

 fixed the absence of \n's (returns) after some of Cujo's barks and
  growls

 Cujo now spawns to the right of the player if possible and will not
  activate at all if there is no room around the player

 Cujo can now be told to break off an attack, or not to attack at all.
  This makes it a lot easier to avoid killing him when you want to
  punch a rocket into what he's attacking.

 Messages concerning Cujo's activation, deactivation and death now
  all appear in the center of the screen, while Cujo's comments appear
  at the top left. (Cujo also whines when he want's to attack and you
  won't let him...)

Changes in version 1.0

 What changes?  This was the first one.
