Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
This is CTF Bot (aka Capture the Flag Bot), a bot that plays ThreeWave
Capture the Flag 3.5.  The unmodified ThreeWave CTF is available from:
http://www.planetquake.com/quakex/threewave/

Before You Install the Modification
-----------------------------------
You should have a basic knowledge of Quake things like config files,
how to use the Quake console, how to edit and use autoexec.cfg files,
etc, before you try to install and use CTF Bot.

If you've never played CTF before then you definitely should try that out
without the bots and read those docs because I assume you know what you are
doing with regard to CTF, i.e. you know how to use the hook, and how to drop
backpacks with ammo, what the runes are, etc.

*IMPORTANT NOTE*:  If you don't have the ThreeWave CTF client mod, you won't
be able to play Capture the Flag with the bots, so go download that now
before you install the bots.  *ALSO* download the ThreeWave CTF server mod
if you want to play CTF on the id maps.  You can download ThreeWave CTF
stuff from http://www.planetquake.com/quakex/threewave/

[SIDE NOTE: Technically, you don't *absolutely* need the ThreeWave CTF client
or server mod to use CTF Bot.  But you won't have any CTF maps to play on.
You could use the non-custom CTF models (i.e. the flags look like keys) and
then create your own CTF map with the dynamic map creation features of CTF
Bot, but that would be very silly and you would miss out on the fantastic
maps, models and graphics that greatly enhance the CTF experience.  Also the
bots will be dumber because they only have waypoints for maps in the ThreeWave
client mod.  But just for the record you can set the teamplay variable in
server.cfg so that CTF Bot does not require the ThreeWave CTF client side
mod.]

Quake may crash if it is given the default 8 Megs of memory.  You should
probably use the "-winmem 16" parameter to give Quake 16 megs of memory when
using this bot. Also, this bot may play too slow on slower machines.  If it
plays too slowly, reduce the number of bots.  I would like to hear if you
have a slow machine and can get acceptable game play.

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

Please read the "Before You Install the Modification" section above!

1) Unzip the CTF Bot zip into a *NEW* directory inside your Quake directory,
   called "ctfbot". This will install the following:

    - ctfbot            [DIR /quake/ctfbot/ ]
        ctfbot10.txt    [ this file ]
        ctfbot.cfg      [ CTF Bot key config ]
        server.cfg      [ *REQUIRED* CTF Bot server config ]
        autoexec.cfg    [ execs ctfbot.cfg and server.cfg ]
        makebots.cfg    [ exec this to make some bots ]
        pak1.pak        [ brains of the bot & red/blue skins ]
        file_id.diz     [ archive description ]
        src.zip         [ source code ]

2) After you have created the ctfbot directory, copy the pak0.pak from the
   ThreeWave capture the flag client mod into the ctfbot directory.  (You can
   get this from http://www.planetquake.com/quakex/threewave/ )  DO *NOT*
   OVERWRITE YOUR EXISTING pak0.pak OR pak1.pak FILES IN THE id1 DIRECTORY!

3) If you want to run CTF in the id maps, download the server mod from
   ThreeWave and follow the directions to convert the id maps into CTF maps,
   then put the converted bsp's in the /ctfbot/maps/ directory.  You will
   also need to edit the server.cfg file to change the percentage of custom
   CTF/id maps when playing if you want the id maps to show up when the
   level changes.  See the ThreeWave server mod docs for more info.

Your final CTF Bot directory structure should look like this:

- quake                 [DIR /quake/ ]
    quake.exe           [ Quake application ]
    - ctfbot            [DIR /quake/ctfbot/ ]
        ctfbot11.txt    [ from CTF Bot zip file - this file ]
        ctfbot.cfg      [ from CTF Bot zip file - CTF Bot key config ]
        server.cfg      [ from CTF Bot zip file - CTF Bot server config ]
        autoexec.cfg    [ from CTF Bot zip file - execs ctfbot.cfg and server.cfg ]
        makebots.cfg    [ from CTF Bot zip file - exec to make some bots ]
        pak0.pak        [ copied from ThreeWave CTF client mod ]
        pak1.pak        [ from CTF Bot zip file ]
        - maps          [DIR /quake/ctfbot/maps/ ]
            e*m*.bsp    [ if you converted id bsp's with ThreeWave server mod ]

4) Run Quake with the following command line parameters:

    -game ctfbot  ==> to use CTF Bot resources (i.e. pak0.pak, pak1.pak)
    -listen       ==> start a listen (i.e. deathmatch) server
    -winmem 16    ==> give Quake 16 megs of ram
    -zone 512     ==> give Quake more ram for config files (optional)

Included is a config file (ctfbot.cfg) that sets up some key bindings for you,
so you can spawn bots quickly (hit F7).  Tweak this file to change the
settings, or just use the following impules to spawn bots and start killing.

Included is a server file (server.cfg) that sets up the various CTF server
variables.  You can tweak this to your liking, for example if you want to
start in a different map by default, or if you want to disable observer
mode or change the teamplay options.  See the ThreeWave CTF server docs
for more info.

TROUBLESHOOTING:  If the flags are not visible, one of the following two
things has happened: either (1) you are in single player mode, or (2)
the file server.cfg is not being exec'ed when you start Quake.  You can
solve (1) by adding the "-listen" param to the Quake command line.  You
can solve (2) by making sure that server.cfg is being exec'ed when you
start Quake (e.g. make sure that autoexec.cfg in the ctfbot directory
has the line "exec server.cfg").  The server.cfg file sets various
server variables that are *REQUIRED* to run CTF correctly.

Impulse Commands
----------------
impulse 100 = (default key F5) = creates a bot on your team
impulse 101 = (default key F6) = creates a bot on the enemy team
impulse 102 = (default key F7) = exec makebots.cfg (makes several bots)
impulse 103 = (default key F8) = bot debug mode (see what bot is thinking)
impulse 104 = (no default key) = turn bot debug off
impulse 105 = (no default key) = creates a red bot (regardless of your team)
impulse 106 = (no default key) = creates a blue bot (regardless of your team)
impulse  40 = (default key p)  = drop current rune
impulse  41 = (no default key) = rune status
impulse  70 = (default key x)  = toggle normal/bot names
impulse 120 = (default key i)  = detailed scores for you
impulse 121 = (default key u)  = detailed scores for everyone
impulse 130 = (default key o)  = toggle observer mode
impulse 199 = (no default key) = help; list all impulses
impulse  80 = (default key z)  = bots report their status
impulse  81 = (default key a)  = order bots on your team to attack
impulse  82 = (default key d)  = order bots on your team to defend

more default keys set in ctfbot.cfg:  F1-F4 sets skill 0-3

plus, all the capture the flag impulses, like impulse 20/21, etc,
see CTF docs for more info (or use impulse 199 to list all impulses
and default key bindings).

Playing Notes
-------------
On some maps, bots use a waypoint scheme to navigate.  Thus the bots are much
smarter on those maps than others. Currently the maps with at least some
waypoints include ctf1 through ctf8.

On maps that do not contain waypoints, a lot of the time it is easy to capture
their flag. If you go in their base, kill all the bots, and snag their flag,
it may be easy to grab their flag again after that if they have all respawned
away from their base, because they won't be able to find their way back.
As a result, some non-waypoint maps work better than others with these bots.
It can still be fun to play on non-waypoint maps, because the bots do
use teamplay tactics.

If you want to play on the id maps that have been converted to CTF, you
need to go to http://www.planetquake.com/quakex/threewave/files.html and
download the server mod so you can convert the id bsp's into CTF bsp's.

An excellent CTF map by Tim Willits of id software based on Gloom Keep (e1m5)
can be found at http://www.planetquake.com/quakex/threewave/idctf1.zip

More CTF maps can be found at: http://www.cdrom.com/pub/quake/levels/ctf/

Also, keep in mind that you can turn any map into a CTF map with dynamic
map creation.  There are hundreds of new maps on the net, so find a good
one and give it a try.  The bots won't have waypoints of course, but they
will try their best.  You could even spawn some waypoints for them if
you're feeling nice.

Bots on Your Team
-----------------
Bots on your team will try to follow you around and help you.  They will
say things like "let's attack" while they are following you, so you know
that you have their attention.  They will sometimes get distracted by
items though. Sometimes the bot wants something but can't get it, but if
you grab it the bot will of course not want it anymore.  If you are far
above or below them, but they are still following you, they will try to
jump down or hook their way up, so you can get them to follow you most
places.  Sometimes you have to just be patient while the dumb bot
figures out how to get where you are, and sometimes you are just out of
luck.  Sometimes it helps to try to get your buddy to try a different
route; e.g. get him to hook his way up somewhere easier and then lead
him to where you want him to be once he gets up there.

Note that it is very helpful to have bots with you.  If you can't get
past a high-skill enemy bot, bring along some buddies.  Let them grab
the good weapons or toss them a rocket launcher and ammo and watch them
kick ass while you get all the glory. :-)

Skill Levels
------------
The console variable "skill" is used as the skill of the next bot
created. Type "skill #" in the console to change the skill, where # is a
number from 0 to 3.  Skill levels don't have to be an integer (i.e. 1.5
or 2.7 are legal). Skill has various effects on play.  Lower skill
levels misjudge target's velocity and position when firing, have smaller
field of view, are less likely to make evasive maneuvers, are less
likely to jump effectively, are less likely to see enemies far away, are
less likely to see enemies with Ring of Shadows, are less likely to jump
away from grenades at its feet, plus tons of other things.

Bots with a skill of 2 or higher use the "visor dude" CTF skin.

Quick Spawning of Bots
----------------------
Included is a file that spawns a series of bots to demonstrate how you
can make a config file spawn various differently-skilled bots easily.
By default you can hit F7 to spawn 4 differently-skilled enemy bots and
2 bots on your team. Edit makebots.cfg to suit your skill level and
desired number of bots.

For some reason exec'ing this file from the console does not work?  You
have to bind it to a key in the console like this:  bind F7 "exec
makebots.cfg"

No Target mode
--------------
Use impulse 130 to toggle no target mode.  When no target mode is on,
bots won't try to target or escort human players, but otherwise
everything is the same.  You can still pick up stuff, and you can still
be harmed by bot crossfire, you can still capture the flag, you can
still kill bots, etc.

Observer mode
-------------
Use impulse 98 to enter observer mode.  Observer mode is like when
you join the server, press 1 or 2 for red/blue team.  When observer
mode is on, you can fly and do not interact with the world at all.
You can't execute impulses as an observer... you must press 1 or
2 to join a team or press jump to join a computer-selected team
before you can execute impulses.

Bot Orders
----------
You can order the bots on your team around with some impulses.  This works
only on maps with waypoints.  Bots will follow your orders for 1 minute, then
start deciding what to do on their own again.

impulse  80 = (default key z)  = bots on your team report their status
impulse  81 = (default key a)  = order bots on your team to attack
impulse  82 = (default key d)  = order bots on your team to defend


Dynamic Map Creation/Modification
---------------------------------
impulse 115 = (default key r)  = move/create red flag
impulse 116 = (default key b)  = move/create blue flag
impulse 117 = (default key a)  = create base stockpile
impulse 118 = (default key e)  = print entity list

Impulse 115/116 creates a red/blue flag where you are standing.
You can only create one red or blue flag.  If you create another,
the first one is removed.  You can use this to move the maps in the
existing CTF levels (e.g. ctf1-ctf8) if you feel like a change.
(Of course if you are playing the bots then the waypoints will
no longer work on those levels.)

In addition to the flag, 9 team spawn points are created when you
create or move a flag.  This is done so that if you want to spawn
some bots, they will appear near their flag.  All other team spawn
points in the level for that team are removed.  If a spawn point
is created in a wall, it is removed.

Impulse 117 creates a respawning stockpile of 1 yellow armor,
1 super nailgun, 1 double shotgun, 2 large boxes of nails, 2
large boxes of shells, and 2 large health boxes.

The above items may behave strangely or will fall out of the level if
they are spawned in a wall or on top of an object or player. Please step
out of the way after creating the items.  You will be warned and be
given 2 seconds before the items are enabled.

Your changes are *NOT* saved with the map.  You have to recreate the
flags and bases every time you quit and restart Quake.  So don't
worry about screwing up your maps; you can't permanently change the
map.

*HOWEVER*, if you want to permanently change a map, you can use impulse
118.  Impulse 118 prints out all entities that you dynamically created.
It prints them to the console in the format used by QBSP for inserting
entities into a bsp file.  If you want to use this feature to
permanently modify a bsp file, start Quake with the -condebug command
line option to save all console text to the file qconsole.log in the
ctfbot directory.  Then add flags or items to the map with impulses
115-117.  Finally, use impulse 118 to list the entities that you
created.  Impulse 118 doesn't print out all the entities in the map,
only entities that you created, so you will have to strip out the
existing entities from the bsp file, paste them together with the
entities printed out in qconsole.log, then use QBSP with the -onlyents
parameter (i.e. as done by the dobsp.bat file in the ThreeWave server
mod) to replace the entities in the bsp file.  If you merely moved a
flag instead of creating a new one, the old team spawn points will still
be in the bsp file, so remember to delete them.  Obviously, don't try
any of this unless you know what you are doing!

Other Impulses
-------------
impulse  40 = (default key p)  = drop current rune
impulse  41 = (no default key) = rune status
impulse  70 = (default key x)  = toggle normal/bot names

Impulse 40 (default key p) drops the rune you are carrying so you
can pick up another.
Impulse 41 prints what rune you have.
Impulse 70 toggles between "normal" names (e.g. "Satan") and bot
names (e.g. "RedBot1").  There are 100 different normal names that
the bots use.  Yes, some of the bots are girls.  Deal with it. :-)

Detailed Scores
---------------
Impulse 120 (default key i) prints detailed scores for you.
Impulse 121 (default key u) prints detailed scores for everyone.
Detailed scores includes number of frags (i.e. actual score), and
also number of kills, deaths, suicides, captures, pickups, assists,
recoveries, and bonuses.  Bonuses are things like fragging the
flag carrier, or fragging the person hurting the flag carrier.

    tries not to blow itself up when using rockets with strength rune)
+ doesn't go after items unless it really needs them (i.e. not an ammo hog)
+ bots explore fairly well
+ bots try to help their teammates who are firing at an enemy
+ bots try to stay near their teammates with the flag
+ no target mode
+ observer mode
+ various bug fixes to ThreeWave CTF code

Not Yet Added/Things To Do/Known Bugs
-------------------------------------
+ bots may be too slow on slower machines, and take up a lot of memory
+ bots don't know how to swim up to avoid drowning (but they try to
    fire hook)
+ bot water levels are not correct (i.e. bot may be able to fire
    thunderbolt in water that a human can't, may not be affected by
    shallow lava, etc.)
+ red bot skins glow
+ bot's don't know about any teamplay modes other than the default CTF
    mode (i.e. can't hurt teammates at all) and will probably kill
	their friends fairly often if teamplay is changed.
+ bots can't travel over broken ground, animation is wrong sometimes,
  and bot movement is jerky.  Hopefully this will be fixed in future
  releases that use a different movement scheme
+ bots tend to try to use the hook to get to high places instead of just
     walking up the stairs/ramp
+ bots don't know when an item is inaccessible, and continue to try to get it
+ bots get telefragged when entering the game with makebots.cfg
+ sometimes bots move at normal running speed when being pulled by the
     hook, especially when going parallel to the floor
+ bots don't necessarily start firing at an enemy that is firing at them;
     they have to notice the enemy first... if they are trying to get
	 a good but inaccessible item they are unlikely to turn around and
	 start firing at the enemy
+ bots don't fire at you when you hook them, making for an easy kill
+ bot player model doesn't pitch up/down quite properly when bot aims up/down
+ bots initially spawn in the floor in ctf2 (what the hell???)
+ no remote administration of bots
+ ctf scoring might be screwed up when bots are involved
+ bots are not affected by sv_aim (not actually a bug because sv_aim
	should always be 1.0 anyway)
+ bots are not affected by and don't know about wind tunnels
+ bots jump into lava/slime too much
+ bots are not very smart about teleporters, buttons, or secrets
+ tons of other stuff of course

Future Plans
------------
+ support new releases of ThreeWave CTF as they are created
+ waypoint support for more maps
+ more dynamic CTF map creation/modification support
+ make bots seem more human
+ make bots smarter in general
+ make bots know more about ctf strategy (i.e. don't leave the base
    undefended to just go exploring)
+ make bots use hook better
+ make various ctf modes, defender, escort, roaming attacker, camper
+ make bots kill the guy who took their flag with higher priority
+ more order impulses
+ allow bots on your team to pick up the enemy flag if there are no
	humans around
+ dynamic bot add/remove code so that smaller teams get bots to help until real
    humans join the server
+ carry bots over to next level
+ make bots hook you intentionally
+ make bots communicate with other bots on its team... let them ask
    for ammo and/or weapons, tell them about a rune on the ground, tell
	them to come back to the base, etc.
+ make bots throw ammo/weapons/runes to its teammates and/or humans that need
    ammo/weapons/runes
+ a guide for map creators on how they can make CTF maps that are bot-friendly
+ dedicated server support

Waypoints Technical Discussion
------------------------------
Bots use waypoints to navigate on certain maps.  Waypoints are basically
"threads" that lead the bot into or out of a base.  Waypoints are
necessary because otherwise bots would have NO knowledge of a level
when they are spawned.  They would wander around randomly and probably
not find their way to the enemy base.  Without waypoints, enemy bots
generally take your flag only if they happen to spawn in your base.
With waypoints, however, bots know exactly how to get into your base
and actually try to go there on purpose.  This makes CTF much more
interesting and challenging, as bots can actually use some CTF strategy.

How to Create Waypoints
-----------------------
Most people will not want to try this because it is too technical.  It's
certainly not required to play the bots.  Several maps already have
waypoints defined, and even on maps without waypoints the bots can be
fun.

The waypoints for the maps the bots know about are compiled into the bot code
and dynamically created when the map starts.  They are not stored as entities
in the bsp so there is no need to use QBSP to modify the bsp file.  The bots
know what map they are playing on and use the waypoints if they have them.  If
there are no waypoints for the map, the bots probably won't capture your flag,
but they will try their best anyway.  As a result, if you want to add
waypoints to a map you will need to modify the code and recompile the bot.
However, there are several impulse commands to help you add waypoints without
having to think about programming at all.  The tricky thing is then testing
your waypoints and figuring out how to pick better points.

A sequence of waypoints is called a path.  Paths always start near a flag,
with waypoint number 0. Waypoint 1 is then nearby, followed with increasing
waypoint numbers as the path goes away from the flag.  Generally paths lead to
a central area.  Any number of paths can exist in a map, but you need at least
2: one from the red flag to a central area and one from the blue flag to a
central area.  Bots are not tied to a specific path, but look for the best
waypoint on *any* path.  From each waypoint on a path you should be able to
see the next waypoint.  So generally you put waypoints in hallway corners.
You should end the path when you can see the end of the other team's path.
For doors and teleporters, you should put the waypoint close enough to the
door/teleporter so that the bot will open the door or go through the
teleporter.  Remember to put waypoints on *both* sides of a door/teleporter,
because paths are two-way!  That is, the bots use the paths to get INTO and
OUT OF a base.

Turn on bot debug (default key F8) to see the waypoints on the maps that
have them.  They are represented by bubble sprites.  You should be able to
see what is going on fairly well.

To create a path, start up Quake with the -condebug parameter so that all
console text is logged to the file qconsole.log in the ctfbot directory.
Then use the following impulses to create a path.  You must be of the same
color as the path (i.e. when you are red you make a red path).

impulse 85 = (default key n) = start a new path of your team
impulse 86 = (default key w) = lay down the next waypoint in path
impulse 87 = (default key q) = print waypoints to console

plus, when you are creating waypoints:

impulse 1-20 = (no default key) = lay down specific waypoint number

When you print waypoints with impulse 87, they are printed in a format that
you can pretty much copy and paste into the bot code (but you have to add
semicolons and you may have to clean up the vectors so that they compile).
Note that *all* waypoints in the map are printed out, not just the ones you
added, so if there are already waypoints in the map they will be printed too.
Don't worry about the order in which the waypoints are printed/created, it
doesn't matter.

Of course, don't try this unless you know what you are doing!

If you create a good group of waypoints for a map, please send them to me so
that I can choose to incorporate them into the master CTF Bot code.  Please
don't send them unless you've tried them out, because it's very easy to
create a set of waypoints, but kind of tricky to create a *good* set.

Currently paths exist only to lead bots from base to base.  Bots do not use
paths for any other purpose.  Future versions will probably support
different kinds of paths, for example paths that lead to a central area
from other parts of the map, so bots can find their way back to a base no
matter where they spawn (e.g. if they spawn in the middle up top in ctf5).

Source Code
-----------
Unzip src.zip to see the source code.  Use the included progs.src which
handles the different directories for the bot source code.  You may have to
edit progs.src to compile the progs.dat into the appropriate directory.

The current code may not do super smart things.  A lot of it is a massive
hack.  Also there are many routines that could be heavily optimized for
speed.

Note that all of the monsters have been removed by ThreeWave CTF 3.5.

If you come up with any cool modifications to this bot, I'd appreciate it
if you emailed them to me, so that I can choose to incorporate them into
the master CTF Bot code.

All changes related to the bot (should be) marked with "CTFBOT", except
in the new bot files of course.  Changes that are not bot related, but
are CTF improvements (like drop rune and CTF bug fixes), are marked with
"CTFBOT EXTRAS".  Of course, I may have missed a few, so do a global diff
to see what really has changed.

Keep in mind that the source code is based on ThreeWave CTF 3.5, and any
modifications you make to the CTF Bot code may be restricted in their
distribution and use.  Read the ThreeWave server mod readme for more info.

Internet Server Use

Feel free to use this work and on your *non-commercial* (i.e. you don't have
to pay to play) Quake server.  Email me (if you feel like it) so I can play on
it too.  Note that it has not been tested so it may not work at all, if you do
any network testing please let me know.  Right now it's definitely not in a
state for use on a totally public server (i.e. anyone can move the flag, and
no dedicated server support).

Bug Reporting/Comments/Suggestions
----------------------------------
Send bugs, comments, suggestions, code snippets, ideas, techniques, whatever,
to drew@interpath.com. For bug reporting, please be as specific as
possible.  Do *NOT* email me binary files without receiving my permission!
