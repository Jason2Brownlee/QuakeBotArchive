Description of the Modification
================================

This is a *MAJOR* update to the original ZEUSbot.  The old code, based
on the TMBot, was *completely* done away with.  The ultimate goal is to
provide an intelligent deathmatch opponent\helper bot.  Eventually, the
source WILL BE RELEASED, but until then, you'll have to get your tidbits
from version 1.4 of Cujo.

The ZEUSbot is both a helper bot and a deathmatch bot.  In single play
he will effectively annihilate just about anything that get's in his way,
and you'll be lucky if you can pick anything up before he does.

The ZEUSbot's death match capabilities are currently under development, but
it's still probably the most intelligent bot available, excepting Steven
Polge's excellent Reaper bot.  Please see the list of future enhancements
for an idea of features that will be added to the ZEUSbot.

=================
Zeusbot Features
=================

Besides being _at least_ as smart as any of the standard Quake enemies, the
ZEUSbot also has a few enhancements:

. can pick up any item a player can pick up.
. knows how to jump intelligently across obstacles, down from ledges and
  into water.
. can fire all of the standard weapons, plus the plasma gun (included in
  this mod).
. knows when an object is unreachable, and will not keep trying for an
  unreachable object.
. based on the player model -- uses all player frames.
. multiskin support for up to 16 skins.
. can swim -- follows and attacks under water.
. can jump out of water onto ledges.
. can navigate broken ground as easily as a human client.
. strafes and circle strafes while attacking.
. chooses its best weapon based on available weapons/distance.
. can use platforms, open secrets, shoot switches and push buttons.
. Has *totally new* movement code which makes it the smoothest and fastest
  bot ever made --   just as smooth as a player character, no jumpiness
  or blitting.
. can roam levels by itself, or follow the player.
. Advances or retreats based on distance from target.
. has all the off-color and corny comments expected from Zeus 1.0, which
  can be enabled/disabled with an impulse.
. can spawn up to 15 opponent and helper bots.
. opponent bots respawn when in deathmatch.
. can be told to attack with only an axe (and he's mighty dangerous with it,
  too).
. can be told to stay or follow, glow, attack or not, teleport to owner,
  and report on his status.
. view toggle between bot's and player's view.
. opponent bots get their own unique name in a deathmatch.
. will not fire when owner or teamate is in between bot and enemy.
. helper bot automatically respawns after each level if he was active
  when the last level ended.  He retains all his weapons, ammo, health
  and armor.
. bot leads target based on skill level.
. bot has a chance to miss with shotguns based on skill level.
. bot's cannot see invisible players until fired upon.
. if teamplay is set, opponent bot's will all be on the same team,
  verses the player.
. has a Holographic Heads Up Display system.
. is generally a badass.

I'm sure I've left a number of things out...
But you should get the picture -- this bot ain't no wuss.


====================
Future Enhancements
====================

These are just a few of the features currently being added to the ZEUSbot:

. still need to do a head model for the bot.  Just haven't gotten around
  to it.
. dynamic level mapping.
. just about anything else that makes the bot better.

PLEASE EMAIL ME WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT!


=====================================
How to use the Zeus bot Modification
=====================================

Helper bot commands:
--------------------
Impulse 100  Activates a helper bot

Impulse 101  Deactivates the last activated helper bot

Impulse 102  Teleports the bot to your current location as long as there is
             room.

Impulse 103  Toggles the bot's glow on and off.

Impulse 104  Reports the bot's status.

Impulse 105  Toggles bot attack mode on and off.

Impulse 106  Toggles between player's and bot's view.

Impulse 107  Toggles the bot's stay status.  When staying, the bot will remain
             where he is until an enemy is sighted or he is told to follow
             again.

Impulse 108  Tell the last created bot to use only his axe as a weapon (this
             is very entertaining, and they happen to be pretty good with it).

Impulse 109  Toggle Zeus comments on and off.  This also toggles enforcer
             sounds on and off.

Impulse 110  Toggle bot roaming on and off.

Impulse 111  Make bot throw backpak (useful if the bot has been picking
             everything up before you can).  The bot will throw the back
             pack to you.  If you are too far away, the bot will pick
             the backpack back up (unless he is staying).

Impulse 112  Toggle holographic HUD display on and off.  Default is on
             for single-play games and disabled for deathmatch games.


Debugging Commands:
-------------------

Impulse 125  Toggle bot verbose mode on and off.  Turn it on if you want to
             know what the bots are doing and "thinking".

Impulse 126  Kill all monsters on current map. (Gib's some, and may cause an
             "no free edicts" error with low memory).

Impulse 127  Toggle player damage.  This is a better cheat than god mode since
             the player does not experience any impact from weapons or twitch
             when hurt.  If you use this in deathmatch while playing with
             another human you are a low-life and you'd better stop -- this
             won't be here in future versions.

Impulse 128  Debug toggle.  Allows printing of some specific messages.

Impulse 129  Show unreachable items.  For debugging use.

Impulse 130  Show opponent distance toggle.  When on, the distance to the
             last-created opponent bot will be displayed.

Impulse 131  Toggle observer mode.  Currently, you can still fire in observer
             mode, but it's only for debugging purposes right now.


Deathmatch Bot Impulses:
------------------------

Impulse 150  Spawn an opponent ZEUSbot.

Impulse 151  Show scores -- shows all player and bot frags (including
             helper bots).  Currently not sorted and not space padded,
             but that will change at some point.

Impulse 152  Spawn 4 bots, at skills 0, 1, 2 and 3, using skins 1, 2, 3
             and 4.


Multiskin Impulses:
-------------------

Impulse 200  Previous skin.
Impulse 201  Next skin.
impulse 202  Multiskin on/off.

Bind these impulses to keys to make commanding the bot easy.  For example,
to make the Q key activate the bot bring down the Quake console by pressing
the ~ key and then type:

BIND Q "IMPULSE 100"

Now, every time you press Q the bot will be toggled between his active and
inactive state.  You can bind the other impulses in the same manner.  When
you exit Quake, the configuration will be saved and you won'y have to do it
again.


Setting Bot Skill Levels:
-------------------------

To set the skill level of the next opponent bot to be spawned,
pull down the Quake console with the ` key and type SKILL X,
where X can be a value from 0 to 3.  The default skill is 1.


Setting Bot Skins:
------------------

Deathmatch Bots With Multiskin ON:
When a bot is spawned, it will use the skin the spawner
is currently using.  After that, the bot will use that
skin until it is deactivated (for helper bots) or the game
is ended.

Deathmatch Bots With Multiskin OFF:
Each bot will choose a particular skin.  For instance, Lord
Brutish will always choose skin 7.  With the default player.mdl
file, however, all bots will be skin 0, except for bot's named
"Zeus" who will be the Zeus bot skin.  This is because the default
player.mdl has only skins 0 and 1.

Using Multiskin OFF with a 16 skin player.mdl will allow you to
recognize certain bots by their skins each time you play against
them.  I recommend getting the Reaper skins file that has 15
skins with different colors that look like real players.  This
may enhance the feeling of being in a deathmatch against humans.
I regret I couldn't make the bots change colors like players, but
that is sadly based on Quake's client/server protocol and will
only work with clients.

Multiskin and Helper Bots:
Multiskin ON or OFF has no effect on helper bots, they will
always use the skin of the player who spawned them. There
is one exception, however.  Helper bots will default to skin
1 (the Zeus skin) if the player is using the default player
skin (skin 0).  If the player is using skin 1, the helper
Zeus will use skin 0.  Otherwise, the bot will use the same
skin as the player when it is spawned.


Using the ZeusBot Camera:
-------------------------

The ZeusBot Camera gives you a helper bot's view of the action.
You can use the camera in either deathmatch or single play.
IMPULSE 106 will switch you to the view of the last helper bot
that you spawned.  There is currently no way to see the view
from any other bot.

You can use IMPULSE 106 to switch back and forth between your
view and the bot's view, in single play you will automatically
be switched to your view after the bot dies. In deathmatch, you
will remain in the bot's view while it respawns.

DeathCam:
If the bot dies while you are seeing from its viewpoint, you will
be treated to the Zeusbot DeathCam.  The camera will move quickly
away from the bot as it dies, spinning around it in circles. This
is usually quite cool to watch, especially when your bot is gibbed.

Using the Holographic HUD:
--------------------------

The Holographic HUD (Heads Up Display) is automatically enabled
in single player and co-op games.  As long as you do not have
a Zeus bot helper, the HUD bars will display your own status.
Once you spawn a bot, the HUD will track the bot's status.  If
your bot dies, the status bar will show your status again.

The red status bar represents health and the yellow status bar
represents armor.  The yellow status bar is always based on the
max for the type of armor being used.  If the bot has 150 yellow
armor, then the bar will be all the way to the top.  Likewise,
if your bot has 200 red armor, the bar will also be all the way
to the top.

You can turn the H-HUD on and off with IMPULSE 112.

Since the HUD actually projects "holograms" in front of the
player displaying status and targeting info, other clients
can see the HUD in a co-op game.  There is also only one HUD
per server, so the last person to activate the HUD in multiplay
would be the only one able to use it, though the other players
could see bot targetting info and the armor/health status
floating in front of that player. If you get too close to a
wall or object, your HUD will be projected beyond the wall,
and you will be unable to see it.


Playing Teams in Deathmatch:
----------------------------

To play against a team of Zeus bots, simply set teamplay to on when
you start your multiplayer game.  All opponent bots you spawn during
that game will team against you.

If you would like to have bots on your own team, you can spawn a
helper bot with IMPULSE 100.  This is great, but now the bot will
just follow you around as a helper.  To make the bot play on his
own, use IMPULSE 110 to turn on his roaming mode.  Now he will no
longer follow you.  Repeat these steps for each team member you
want to create.

You will always be able to command the last bot helper bot you
create.  When you remove the last one, you will be able to command
the bot that was created before it was.


================================
How to Install the Modification
================================

READ THIS SECTION IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE, BEFORE EMAILING ME!
If you still can't figure it out, please email me and try to be
specific about at what point you are having trouble, and what
error messages, if any, you are recieving.

1) Create a directory within the Quake directory called ZEUS.

2) Unzip the files from this archive into that directory, using the -d
   option with PKUNZIP.  Winzip will create the correct directories
   automatically.

3) Start Quake by typing: QUAKE -GAME ZEUS

4) Play with the god of the lightning bolt.


==================
Technical Details
==================

Code: 7400 lines
Time: ~80 hours (getting up there)

Known bugs and peculiarities:
-----------------------------

. bots can become confused if more than 3 unreachable items are
  within view.  This is an arbitrary value and can be increased if
  needed (at the cost of more memory, of course).

PLEASE EMAIL ME WITH ANY BUGS YOU FIND.  When you email me, please try
to be specific about the nature of the bug and under what circumstances
it occurred.  If I cannot reproduce the bug, it is very unlikely that I
will be able to fix it.


====================
Version Information
====================

Changes in version 2.042

. bots are no longer solid right after dying and until respawning.
. bots don't keep going after weapons they already have when deathmatch
  is set to 2.
. removed the debugging message that was popping up each time a bot died.
  It said "Damnit!" and fit well with what the bot might be thinking if
  it were capable of such.


Changes in version 2.041

. Fixed bot view.  It was the llamas again.

Changes in version 2.04

. NO MORE SPLASHING!
. MAJOR changes to the roaming AI.  Bot is now a lot better
  at getting out of rooms and finding new items.
. Various bug fixes to the running frames, follow code, etc.,
  that were causing dm bot's to stutter-step and look a bit
  jerky.
. bots will shoot switches and secret doors that require it.
. bots will follow owner and enemies through teleports.
. bots now go for teleports, platforms, switches and doors.
. bots choose appropriate weapons to shoot switches/doors.
. NEW BOT VIEW with BOT DEATH-CAM.  This is just totally cool.
  There's simply other way to describe it... just plain bad.
. unreachable items at a high pitch should no longer confuse
  the bot.
. Modifications to the Zeus skin.  Still not finished, but I
  get bored working on it...
. fixed a potential problem with bots spawning at the same
  angle the player was looking.  If the player was tilted
  down in water while spawning a bot, the bot would be stuck
  looking down.  This potentially affected movement and all
  sorts of things, but no more.
. HUD updates are twice as smooth and do not lag annoyingly
  anymore.
. bots no longer get their heads stuck in low ceilings.
. bots will not run into shallow lava or slime (except when
  strafing or backing away in battle - much like humans).
. bots no longer float when killed under water.  They sink
  like bricks.
. removed the "thud" sound that bots made when they landed.
  This sound is not made by players, so it's gone.  The only
  side effect is that fiends will not make the sound either
  when they land.  Too bad.  Quake was making this sound
  without my help, so I just turned it into a null .wav file.
. bots swim better and go for air better.
. roaming bots can jump into the water sometimes for the hell
  of it.
. helper bot's can go rogue.  If you're helper Zeus gets upset
  with you, well, you had better run, or have a big gun.  Once
  he's rogue, if you kill him in deathmatch he will keep
  respawning on his own as an opponent, but he'll go after
  everything with an axe.  The bot will warn you when he's
  sick of your crap.
. fixed the stupid "stand up" bug when a helper bot died.
  It was so lame I can't believe I left it in there.  Some
  llama must have been grazing on my code. (thanks to
  JumpA for mentioning this, as I had somehow completely
  missed it!)
. bot's now make pain sounds when in lava, slime, etc.
. adjustments to aiming code to make bots miss more, especially
  on lower skill levels.
. multiskin support.
. disabled H-HUD in deathmatch.
. fix a bug with the plasma gun that would not allow you to select
  the plasma gun when you were out of nails.
. Increased plasma gun's velocity by 1/3 to make it more effective.
  Bolts now travel at the same rate as nails.
. Players and bots now spawn with 25 cells, to make up for the lack
  of cells on most of the standard levels.
. if you are killed by an opponent bot in death match, you may be
  lucky enough to be treated to the Zeus bot taunt cam.  You'll know
  when it happens...

Changes in version 2.03

. added the holographic HUD.

. removed some of the water movement code.  It was getting Zeus
  stuck in places he used to do fine.  The end result is that he
  will get stuck more often when going for air.


Changes in version 2.02

. helper bots no longer spawn on top of one another if the
  player doesn't move before spawning.
. bots now drown and will go for air when they need it.
. added the "throw backpack" command in an attempt to head off the
  email complaining about Zeus being an item hog.  I'd say he's
  just damn efficient.
. fixed bot jumping.  Jumps are now more accurate, and bot's find
  ledges when they should.
. bots can no longer jump amazing distances (it was cool, but
  it wasn't quite fair).
. fixed ChanceToHit with shotguns so that non-moving entities
  always recieve the highest chance for that skill.  Monsters
  that use MOVETYPE_STEP will always get highest chance, unless
  jumping or falling because they don't use actual velocity
  factors to move -- no big deal only affects helper bots.
. fixed helper bot levels (they were not having their levels set,
  resulting in skill 0 helper bots, which is lame!)
. implemented ledge detection.  YES!  This one REALLY SUCKED. Bot's
  are now much less likely to run off a ledge.  But they may still
  jump into lava like the fools they are... =)
. start-up info message added.
. fixed a bug with unreachable items that was the result of my
  absentmindedness...
. bot will now search for items above and below for up to 2 seconds
  before deciding they are unreachable.  The bot used to check the
  pitch to the item, but this changes to much as the bot moves and
  was not doing the job.
. modified bot's swim routines.  Bot no longer sinks too fast.  In
  fact, the bot is a damn good swimmer and will just barely sink at
  all.

Changes in version 2.01

. Skill levels implemented.
. Target leading implemented.
. Target missing and chance to hit implemented (for line-tracing
  weapons such as the shotgun).
. bots will no longer see invisible players unless they are attacked
  by one.
. enhanced ability to chase player out of sight
. fixed weapon ranges so bot will fire from greater distances

Changes in version 2.0

. While this is the second version of the Zeus bot this was truly the
  first version of this code.  Seeing as Zeus 1.0 was based on the
  TM bot and was my first attempt at doing anything with Quake C, it
  doesn't really count as the same bot -- it just has the same name.

Answers to Common Questions
============================

Here are answers to some of the most common questions I recieve about my
Quake C mods:

Q: How can I use your mod when I'm playing internet deathmatch games?
A: You must find a server that is already running the mod.  That is the
   only way, besides starting your own server.

Q: Help! How come I can't get your mod to work?!?!?
A: You are doing something wrong. =)  They work for everyone else.  Please
   read the instructions very carefully and do everything exactly like they
   say.  If something is still unclear, then email me, and please be clear
   about exactly the problem you're having -- "Cujo won't work" doesn't give
   me any clue as to what the real problem might be.  For example: "I
   installed the file into C:\GAMES\QUAKE\CUJO and ran the game with
   QUAKE -GAME CUJO but nothing happens when I use IMPULSE 100."  Makes a lot
   more sense and lets me know almost exactly what the problem is.  If you
   recieve any error messages, be sure to include those in your mail also.

Q: Can you add so and so or change so and so in the next release?
A: Probably so.  Please email any suggestions or complaints that you have.
   The whole point is to make something that other people enjoy using, so
   I've got to have other people's input!

Q: Can I use your mod in a compilation mod I am creating?
A: Read the copyright and distribution permissions, then please email me
   and tell me about it.  If you use any of my mods as a base or addition to
   any other project, you must credit me and include an address\location where
   my original mod can be found.  Also, I will try to help you if I can, but
   please do not expect me to bug hunt for you.  If you modify my source code,
   the bugs that crop up are your ultimate responsibility.
