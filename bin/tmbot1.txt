Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
Automated Helper Bot or Player 2 on only one computer!
With this advanced AI you can conquer any level of Quake.
TM Bot is based on the Enforcer Model.
Just activate the bot and he'll be completely automated, or you can
take control and wreak some havoc with multi-player fun.

Somebody tell us how it plays in Co-Op
(Doesn't attack other players...can easily change that
for DM mode).

How to use Modification
-------------------------------
Impulse 100 Activates and Deactivates the Bot

Impulse 101 Toggles between Automatic and Manual Control Modes

Impulse 102 Auto: Fires Weapon
Manual: Toggle bot movement-Stop/Walk/Run

Impulse 103 Auto: Toggle auto-fire
Manual: Turn left

Impulse 104 Auto: Teleport to player
Manual: Turn right

Works best with a 4 button joystick (gravis gamepad) here's a diagram:

2
1 4
3

Button 2 would fire / move
Button 1 would toggle auto fire / turn left
Button 4 would teleport / turn right
Button 3 would toggle auto mode / manual mode

And you could assign bot activate/deactivate to the keyboard.

(This is the way we have it set up)


How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

Make a directory called TMBOT off of your quake directory.
Unzip the archive into the TMBOT directory. Now run quake, adding
"-game tmbot" to the command line (do not type the quotes). Bind
the impulses and you're ready to go.

If you would like to see the source code, modify it, or
recompile it, we have included it in the source.zip file. All
modifications to original source have been marked with "TM Bot".


Technical Details
-----------------

Features:

1. Manual or automatic control of the bot.
2. Bot can draw enemy fire.
3. Seeks out monsters and attacks them.
4. Can activate trigger fields on the floor (like
the lights on E1M1 when going down the spiral ramp).
5. Can go through teleport portals.
6. Tries to return to player when player gets too
far away.
7. Does not attack other players (good for coop).
8. And many more.

Bugs:

1. Bot is insubstantial to its owner.
2. Owner cannot hurt the bot with axe, shotgun, or lightning.
3. Bot cannot trigger buttons on the wall. (Does not trigger
the slipgates, but that is by design.)
4. Bot cannot jump or walk past edges.
5. Bot sometimes gets lost.
6. Certain functions (i.e. teleport, move, etc.)
interrupt the dying process giving you a ghost bot
that is insubstantial and unkillable.
7. Level changes may not be handled correctly by my code
(Bot may not be deactivated, just lost).
8. And hopefully not many more.


Future Enhancements:

1. Streamline code and make it faster.
2. Deathmatch toggle (seek out opposing players).
3. Advanced AI (think ahead).
4. Permanent Bot (travels with you to different levels).
5. Bot able to pick up and use health, armor, and ammo.
6. Bot regenerates power cells, but requires cell ammo
for startup.
7. New models, weapons, or sounds for the bot.
8. Camera Mode (see through bot's eyes).
9. Many more.
