			  VERSION  1.07

----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Welcome to Quake Requiem. This patch is designed to enhance Quake 
and it's playabilty as both a single player and multi-player game.
Since there are no monsters in this patch, only bots, it is strongly
recomended that you do not attempt to play in Single-Player Mode.
This patch was designed to run in Multi-Player (deathmatch) mode, 
either against other deathmatch players or against the computer
controlled roBOTs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

  This patch includes new weapons, bots, Capture the Flag with Manual
Placement, powerup runes, jumping boots, jetpack, holos, radar with 
electric direction locator, and a few other little things you'll have
to find out for yourself... :)

  You can find this TXT file and patch at...

	-------		The Good Stuff		--------

-Weapons-

Pressing each weapon button will cycle through the various weapons.

1-AXE

	Flaming Axe 	-	Throws flaming torches.
			-	The first 10 stay for 45 seconds, the 
				rest disappear after 4. Low damage.

				air. Good defensive weapon. Can move
				objects, or deflect missiles. :)
	Grappling Hook	-	The ol' classic with keyboard control.

2-SHOTGUN

	Shotgun		-	Slightly refined.
	Phaser		-	Like the Enforcer's but faster.

3-DOUBLE-BARREL SHOTGUN	

	DoubleBarrel	-	Much more powerful and wider spread.

	GibGun		-	Shoots 3 green gibbos which sap energy
				from your enemy and then gives it to you.
				Only a health pack will destroy the gibbbos.

similar with only minor adjustments. With RUNES, also comes some extra

-Teamplay Modes-

  Teamplay is primarily the same as in ThreeWave's CTF. Typing TEAMPLAY then 
the number of which options you wish to play.
  My favourite is TEAMPLAY 1507, which is...
	1024+256+128+64+32+2+1
		
	HEALTH_PROTECT =	   1;   // No health damage from friendly fire
	ARMOR_PROTECT =		   2;   // No armor damage from friendly fire
	ATTACKER_DAMAGE =    	   4;   // Attacker takes damage from hitting teammates
	FRAG_PENALTY = 		   8;   // One frag penalty for killing teammate
	DEATH_PENALTY =		  16;   // Die when you kill a teammate.
	LOCK_COLORS =		  32;   // Allow only team colors
	STATIC_TEAMS =		  64;   // Don't allow players to switch teams
	DROP_ITEMS =		 128;	// Disabled
	CAPTURE_FLAG =	 	 256;	// Play capture the flag
	TAG =			 512;	// Not operational as yet... Almost complete
					   Due for release in REQUIEM.1.07
	MANUAL_PLACEMENT =	1024;	// Place your team flags yourself!

CTF-MP (Capture The Flag - Manual Placement) -

  The problem with the old CTF, was that you had to modify each map and
then the flags were always in the same place.
	
  With CTF-MP, you place your own flag where-ever you want it. This, I think,
adds a new element to CTF. Now you have to find the flag before you can take it.

  The first player of each team is set as Team-Leader and holds their flag.  
Hitting 'P' (impulse 15) drops the flag where you stand. After 3 seconds, any 
teammate can run over the flag and pick it up to move it elsewhere.
  While in PLACEMENT mode, being that both flags HAVE-NOT been placed, neither team
is able to shoot. Nor can you pick up the opositions flag, so no cheating. To aid
the flag-placers, the Team-Leader, carrying the flag, will be invisible, so you can 
run around and find a secret place a little easier without being followed. :)
  Once BOTH flags are dropped, and ONLY then, the game begins and the flags can no 
longer be picked up and moved. So think about where you place your flag, you may not
get another chance to move it.


- TAG -
 
 Just your regular game of tag.
 The TAGee is RED, and glowing. All other players are BLUE.

 As the TAGee, you get DoubleDamage up front, and get double frags.
 Health and Armour regenerate.

 This mode is still under construction. Any advice or comments, please email me.
Due for release with REQUIEM 1.07

- BOTS -

  By hitting 'B' (impulse 100), you can create a roBOT, which will act as another
player, who can do everything you can do, and use the same weapons as you. You 
create up to 16 BOTs at the moment.

  You can also change the skill of each bot so that you play against a dummy, or
a whole bunch of crack-shooters. To do this, type SKILL at the prompt. This will
show the current skill level. When you hit 'B' (impulse 100), the BOT will
assume the current skill level. Skill levels range from 0 - 5. Default is 2.
  This means you can have different BOTs of different skills at the same time,
simply by changing the skill level between creating BOTs.
  Bots also use the HOOK quite alot, so you may want to get used to using it 
yourself.

  BOTs are not really supported under TEAMPLAY modes, however, I have been playing 
with the TEAMPLAY settings, and you can play a 2-team TEAMPLAY game but using
TEAMPLAY 35 at the very least. Check the options above to see what 35 does. Not sure
what would happen in other TEAMPLAY modes and more than 2 teams, as I am doing all
my testing on one PC. :(

  Typing REMOVE_BOTS will destroy all bots, incase you just cant handle dying... ;)

- GAMEPLAY -

  There are a few things to look out for.

 When using the FreezeBomb, it would be advisible to not shoot it at close range
as you will be frozen too. The actual Bomb lasts 7-12 seconds, after which every
entity it has frozen, is thawed. The only weapon that protects against the 
FreezeBomb is the FlameThrower. If you are using the FlameThrower, you can't 
be frozen.

 When you are hit by the GibGun, your energy is sapped rather quickly. The only
way to kill the little critters that take your energy is to pick up a health
pack. This will destroy the green gibbo thingos that take your energy.

 The Radar shoots out a lightning beam towards the closest enemy in short bursts
repeating according to how close they are. This can only be seen by yourself, but
the problem is when you are using the LightningGun, you may get confused. Please
keep this in mind when using the Radar.

 Proximity mines will sit there waiting for someone to detonate them for only
30 seconds before they explode automatically. You can only shoot 10 at a time.

 Ever wanted to walk through lava? Well.. if you have the freeze gun, you can.
The newly designed freeze gun eminates a protective cold force field that 
protects you against lava... (erk fnarr fnarr) hehehe... try it out.

 If you want to know who's winning using a new scoring system, hit 'Z' (impulse 44)
to bring up a scoreboard, which also includes BOTs, showing FRAGS, DEATHS, and 
who is overall at the top. 


		- Please Note-
	There are NO monsters in this patch!

This is due to the size and complexity of this patch. Since Quake does have its
limits, all the monsters and their code had to be removed to allow for all the
new weapons, items, bots and teamplay options. I apologise to all the avid 
single-player fans, but that's how ID made Quake. I will be trying to replace
as many monsters as possible when the rest of the patch is complete, size
permitting.

	-----------	The Next Project	-------------

			- T H E - Z O N E -

	This is a very exciting update, and I dont want to say too much to give it 
away just yet, but, it's a totally new teamplay option that I think will take the
world by storm. I'll keep you posted.  :)

  Currently under construction. 


	--------	  That's it for now...		--------

	Once again, thanks to everyone who helped out on this endeavour.

This patch is still not finished and I am making modifications almost every day, 
so don't be disheartened if something doesn't work properly yet, or it's lacking 
that something special you feel NEEDs to be there. Email me:)

I welcome ANY and ALL comments and suggestions. If you have something you wish
to contribute, whether it be a suggestion or even code, please send me an email.
If I use your stuff, I would be only to happy to acknowledge your contributions, 
both in the game and in the TXT file. Afterall, I'm only trying to make one of
the best and most popular patches according to you, the players. So it's up to you!

  Before I go, I'd just like to take this opportunity to thank all those awesome
Quake-C programmers who's source code and ideas I have used and learnt from. I'd 
also like to thank all the great people who helped test and refine this patch, 
especially all the Quakesters in #quake on IRC, like Ado, mrgibbed, Freek, Freaek, 
ZiNC, Indiana, VuduChild, Netspawn, Vol(mr.impulse12), AirSwing, Summoner, Manowar,
Platinum and all the fantastic people who sent me bug reports and kind emails, and 
even aaargh who said this whole patch was crap! (hehehe)
