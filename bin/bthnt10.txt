Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
 Impulse 100 creates 1 bot, but up to 13 with different names.  
 This(these) bot(s) will help you in co-op and kill you in deathmatch. My   
 computer sucks and can only handle up to 9. These bots will be
 like a real player.  Can pick up everything, but the invisibility
 does not work right and the biosuit doesn't matter.  They gib if they 
 happen to fire lightning underwater.  They can use all weapons and
 will resort to the axe when out of ammo.

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
 Make a directory under quake called "bhunt"
 and unzip "bthnt10.zip" into it.  Then run
 Quake by typing "quake -game bhunt".
 Chose multiplayer, new game, direct connect, 
 and begin.  See above.

Technical Details
-----------------
This is the first release of Bot Hunt.

It is based mostly on BgBot thanks punisher!!

	If you can help me make him look like he is using 
 the axe, jump at the right times, run while firing, avoid
 enemy fire, swim or anything else you think is not right 
 with this please contact me at:
