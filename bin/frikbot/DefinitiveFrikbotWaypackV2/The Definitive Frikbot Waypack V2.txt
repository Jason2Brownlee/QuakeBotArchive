Mat 24th, 2011 - Version 2
Author:  Lightning Hunter (see below for more credits)
Title:  The Definitive Frikbot Waypack (Version 2)
Game: Quake, for use with the Frikbot modification
Creation Time:  Waaay too long.  I'd say about 6 months on and off for the original release, plus an additional year for the version 2 release.

---------DESCRIPTION----------
This pack adds bot support for about 500 user created Quake maps.  It is for use with the wonderful Frikbot, created by Frika C.  About
280 of these waypoints were created by me (I think, it was hard counting), while the rest were created by various artists - but heavily improved by me.
When I say heavily improved, I mean that I spent just as much time improving the other 221 maps as I did creating my own waypoints!
I was very meticulous about making sure each and every map had the best bot support possible.  I didn't slack off in any one map!  For this very reason,
I have titled this pack the Definitive Frikbot Waypoint Pack.  You will not find a more complete archive of Frikbot waypoints - all of them the very
best quality! 

--------ORIGINAL AUTHORS AND UPDATE INFORMATION---------
As stated above, 280 of these waypoints were created by me.  The rest were done by the various authors listed below, with improvements by me.
I was tempted to claim all 500 waypoints as my own - because in most cases, I'm sure I spent as much time updating/testing the waypoints 
by other authors as I did creating my own.  In some cases, I really think it would have been faster to do all of them from scratch!  There were
so many issues here and there with the original waypoints that I spent forever tweaking each and every waypoint.  
The improvements really show, however.

Here are the original authors of the 221 waypoints:
Bta.Monster
CocoT
Quest
Electro
Plumb
Frika C
Dr. Shadowborg
Igor9

I believe that covers everyone.  To see individual credits, open up the .way files!  The authors are credited in each one.

Special thanks to Frika C and Dr. Shadowborg for answering general Frikbot questions.  They were very responsive!

------INSTALLATION---------
1.  Extract the contents of the archive to your Quake\Frikbot folder (make sure you have folder names turned on!)
If all went well, the waypoint files should be in the Frikbot\maps folder.  If not, then go ahead and put them there!

WARNING:  THIS NEXT STEP WILL MODIFY 47 MAPS; READ BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION!
2.  Install the ENT patches by going to your map folder, and opening "ENT Patches.bat". This will modify the code of 47 maps, to allow bot support.
after this step is done, you may delete QBSP.EXE, ENT Patches.bat, and all the .ent files if you wish.  It won't harm anything if you wish to leave them
in the folder, however.

3.  Playing is easy.  Simply load a supported map like normal (with the Frikbot mod loaded), and you will see that the waypoints were loaded.  If not,
then something went wrong with your installation.

-IMPORTANT!!!  There were many maps that had issues with Frikbots that were beyond the control of my waypoints.  A few of the supported maps won't
load the waypoints, unless you complete step number 2 above.  These issues are usually because of authors including waypoints in the .ent files for other bots, 
or problems in the Frikbot code itself.  I didn't want to include the modified .bsp files themselves to respect the mappers - so instead, I included
ENT files along with QBSP.exe, and a .bat file to automatically patch all the maps.  If you play a lot online and need these maps unchanged, then make sure
you patch them in a separate folder for offline use!  If you do not run the ENT patches, then 47 of the supported maps will either have major issues, or not
work at all.

------WHERE DO I DOWNLOAD THE MAPS?-----------
Due to the rarity of some of the supported maps in this pack, I have uploaded a hefty pack that contains ALL 500 maps.  This file is called 
DefinitiveFrikbotMappack.zip, and should be found in the same place you downloaded this.  If you can't find it, then try heading over to the official
forum thread over at Quakeone, and hopefully all the links still work:

If all else fails and you can't find a download link, contact me below.  I've listed several methods.  You should be able to get your hands on this 
somehow! :) 

------VERSION HISTORY-----------

Version 1:  Support for nearly 400 maps.

Version 2:  Support added to about 100 more maps, bringing the total to around 500.  All filenames changed to lowercase, to prevent conflicts.

------Permissions----------
There are no restrictions on this release.  If anyone feels like adding more waypoints to a future release of this pack, feel free to do so!
I would really appreciate it if you would contact me, so we could collaborate on it.  I'd love to work with someone on getting even more
waypoints completed!
