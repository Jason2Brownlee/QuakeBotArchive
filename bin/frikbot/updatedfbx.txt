Yes, I do! I'll upload it in a bit for you here. I'll just send you the bot_*.qc files... I also added igor9's (I think that's his name) advanced item pickup code that he used for FBX+. I didn't make the aim offsets myself, I dug around in some old mods I had laying around, and found that Wazat's Jeht mod (awesome mod by the way) had aim offsets implemented. Granted they aren't perfect, but make things much more fair.

Wazat also added in some aiming delays so you don't get nailed with a rocket the instant you come through a teleporter or whatnot. Those behaved sort of odd for me however (bots waiting 3 seconds to fire much too often), so I never added those to NewDM.

Later I may add in some simple interpolation code that r00k suggested to make the aim offsets not appear as jerky. Dividing the offset angle by / 65535 is what does it. I'll have to try that and playtest it myself to see how it works.

-- I've also updated the main post with a thanks list!
