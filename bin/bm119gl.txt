=============================

===================

===================
Read these files:  /manuals/*.txt




=================================
New Botmatch.dat (progs.dat) features
=================================
--Full water support (bots will swim almost like real players).
--Advanced match features : overtime support,accuracy stats support (available at any part of the game),quadstats - quad weapon efficiency,high score table(available at the end of matches).Overtime toggles ONLY if 2 players or bots or 2 teams (with teamnames). 
--QW KT-style comments during game(like team[xxx] leads by xx frags),etc.. 
--Auto-loading bots. Bots will try to connect and then disconnect after user-definable time-limit. 
--BugFIXES: - Completely removed all NULL-function FATALITIES.
	- Memory leak fixes. 
	- Cache mismatch in GL. (thx qsg.telefragged.com).
	- Console typing enhancements (insert mode by default).
	- Allows multiple connections from a single IP address.
	- Precise aim for clients (controllable with cl_cross_x and cl_cross_y cvars).
	- Larger console buffer.
--Cool logging support.When timelimit or fraglimit is reached,if 'autostats' cvar enabled - engine logging advanced players and bots statistics.Logging format you may see in 'newcmds.cfg'.Log example you may found at ./stats/(hostport)/. This feature is very useful for stats lovers - like me :)
--Bots teamnames now shows on scoreboard (including their teamfrags and etc..). 
--Markers improovements:DM3 - water way and ring-quad jumping;DM6: RJ from GA to cells;other listed maps - rocketjump (see maplist). 
--Advanced evasive strategies. Toggle is 'botevade'. Enabled by default. 
--Good CAMPING AI. (dm6 and dm3 so far..). Toggle is 'botcamp'. Enabled by default. 
--Bots will automatically try to help any teammate in their team if he close enough and really needs help.  Toggle is 'bothelp'. Enabled by default. 
--Improoved think function (water code related). 
--Identify teammate function.Idea taken from Q2 OSP-Tourney Mod.If 'ident' is enabled,there's a short sentence appears at the bottom on status-bar ,looks like "teammate [9]Xenon". 
--Bots will report their status and locations if 'botreport'is enabled and loc-file loaded. Available in teamplay only. Location names called from loc-files in moddir/locs
--Talk abilities.Including RUSSIAN TALKS :)) and English talks.. 
--Gibfilter (low and high)- 'highgibs' and 'lowgibs' cvars. 
--New GIBS models. 
--32-bit dat-file ('unlimited' pr_globals..)
--Extended obituaries.
--Lavajumping feature (rocketjump from lava). 
--'Shot for luck' feature (sometimes bots shooting from RL for luck, even if enemy is not visible).
--Shotable buttons and doors support.
--Other minor features i forgot to mention. 


====================================================
New GL-(WIN-)BOTMATCH.EXE (gl(win)quake.exe) features
====================================================

--Synthetic lag. One of the coolest feature..
--User-definable teamnames (like in QW) 
--New cvars (see 'newcmds.cfg').Type 'cvarlist'. 
--Advanced deathmatch scoreboard. Ripped from QW,but added 'rank','eff','blunders' (in teamplay). 
--User-definable MOTD (loading from ./dmmotd.txt). 
--Other cosmetic improovements.


=========================
Important notes
=========================
--Do not use old Frogbot names editors (like fbedit.exe), cos it's not understand "teamname=" option. Due to that fact, botfiles always will be created with error in "lines="..
--Do Not use ANY gl(win)quake.exe,quake*.exe,and etc - game WILL crash, cause I've changed pr_global_struct and network protocol. Do not try also use ANY of coming up other exe's (the game will not work properly).
--Do NOT rename botmatch.dat to progs.dat - game WILL crash.
--Do NOT use decompiler - ask me for source if needed !!


=========================
Teamnames Support
=========================
If you want spawn a bot with teamname visible on status bar open any bot-file (in bots folder) and edit file directly by adding folowing lines:
wait;teamname=
wait;impulse 54  // "6"
wait;impulse 54  // "6"
wait;impulse 54  // "6"
wait;impulse_0    //end teamname
Don't forget to modify "lines=" parameter.
