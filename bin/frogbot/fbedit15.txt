Frog Bot Editor was designed to make bot files for the FrogBot mod for Quake.

Frog Bot created by Robert Fields.

Using Frog Bot Editor

This does not require a degree to use. It allows you to make bot files. I was 
asked to program this so you can easily make "fun names" for the bots.

The Menu 
    File-New 
        Create a new bot. Will prompt you to save if you have made changes to 
        the currently loaded bot. 
    File-Save As 
        Saves the bot file. Give it a dos compatible names (no long file name). 
        The Bot list will refresh after saving. 
    File-Exit 
        Quits the bugger! 
    Edit-Change Bot Directory 
        Unloads all bots loaded, and reads in all bots from the directory you
        select. 
    Edit-Delete This Bot 
        Deletes the currently loaded bot.
    Create-frogbot.cfg 
        This scans the bot directory and makes all of the alias statements for 
        every bot file listed. 
    Help-About 
        A few words about this program and its purpose. 
    Help-ReadMe File 
        Loads this file, with lots of words about the program and its purpose. 

Creating a bot file 101

Step 1.
Giving the bot a name:
The bot has to have a name, that is why I made the damn program!!!!!
Click the name picture and you will see the Name Editor portion of FBEdit.
At the top is the name of the bot, in Quake characters of course. There is a
yellow box here, showing you where the cursor is. LEFT Click to move the cursor
to a certain position. RIGHT click to delete the letter where the mouse is.
The keyboard may be used as well, utilizing the Home-End-Insert-Delete-Arrow
keys-Shift-Capslock, and holding down the CTRL key will type in the Gold color.
Easy enough! Right? God!
At the bottom is the character grid. Move the mouse over this, and a little
box will follow the cursor around. Click the mouse to put the letter in the 
name.
Click OK or close the window to return to the Main Editor window with the new 
name.

Step 2.
Check the box for the item you wish to use.
I.E.
Check Shirt, if you want to designate the Shirt color of the bot.

Setting Shirt-Pants-Team Shirt-Team Pants:
Below you will see the Color Codes for these items. Adjust them accordingly.
Select one of the following from the drop down list.

COLOR CODES  
0 = WHITE 
1 = BROWN
2 = LIGHT BLUE/GREY 
3 = GREEN 
4 = RED 
5 = GOLD 
6 = PINKISH ORANGE 
7 = LIGHT BROWN 
8 = PURPLE 
9 = LIGHT PURPLE 
10 = LIGHT GREY 
11 = AQUA 
12 = BRIGHT YELLOW 
13 = BRIGHT BLUE
14 = RANDOM  

NOTE: RANDOM is a new option, and the Frog Bot Mod will choose any of the colors
available for you.

Setting Skill:
Skill can be set between 0 and 200. The Normal skill of the FrogBot is 100.

Setting Skin:
Check to use it, scroll to select. You need a player.mdl for this. Don't ask,
I just put it in cause they asked nicely :}

Step 3.
Save it! If you did not give it name, the program will kick your ass. Actually
it will just remind you to name the bot. When you save the bot, the Bot list box
is refreshed, and you will see your bit listed. FBEdit attempts to create a name
for the file by evaluating the letters in the Frog Bots name. Change it as you 
wish, but remember to use DOS file name conventions, no LONG file names.

The Bot List will refresh after you Save As, and after you Create a FROGBOT.CFG
to reflect the new file names in the Frog Bot directory.

See the FrogBot documentation for info on where to put the files, and how to 
spawn them in Quake. 

Frog Bot Editor is Freeware
You can do whatever you want with this program, as long as I get credit for it:}
Total Time Programming this sucker: about 24 hours.
