are many, many bugs. If you find any it
is ok to mail me about it. Just don't go

 Impulse 100 creates 4 bots.

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
Make a new dir in your quake directory. (ie c:\quake\bg)
then move this pak0.pak into that directory and copy your
*.cfg from c:\quake\id1 into the same directory.
Then from the c:\quake dir. type:

        quake -game bg

then bind a key to impulse 100

From the console type:
        bind b "impulse 100"

Technical Details
-----------------
Any bugs lemme know please?

COMING IN NEXT RELEASE:
#1------Dedicated server support. (by popular demand.)
#2------More extreme personality differences.
#3------2 more body MDL's.
#4------Better ability to dodge and jump out of the way.
#5------Many more...just I cant remember..heh...
#6------For some reason they dont like to use doors. They
        can, but they dont ever get close enough. FIXING IT!

PROBLEM AREAS:
#1------Trying to get the bots score to come up on changelevel or when
                player dies. Cant seem to figure it out.(ie brain fried.)
                If anyone can lend some insight, lemme know.
#2------Ability to walk into water, swim, and walk over cracks
                in floor.
#3------Better roaming AI. STILL!!!!!
#4------In Teamplay, Coop, and one player he is pretty useless on any
                level that has cracked floor, stairs, water, etc.
#5------Need to find a way to display the name of the bot who telefrags.
                Doesn't work well. Displays a big blank.

VERSION 2.00a:
        Tad bit smarter. (I know not enough though!)
        Bot's are now use 4 different code bases. They all have
                their own brain per-say. I know that as of now
                it is minimal in the diferences, but soon it will
                be grand.
        There are now 3 custom MDL's. 2 bodies and 1 head!!! heh.
                (please do not use the mdl's in anything unless you
                 have express written consent from Phillipe Doyon
                 see above credit, and copywrite areas.)
        Bot jumps out of the way if his enemy has a rocket.
                (kinda lame but it will get better.)
        Fixed bot's jumping a little. He doesn't keep jumping as much.
        Lava bug fixed.
        Nail gun now fires almost normaly.
        Many minor things...I just have brain fryage.
