Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
 What started as a TM bot has drasticly changed.
Now using the Player model, in Deathmatch these 4
menacing bots will have you on your toes. Respawning
when they die. In one player or coop, one bot will
help conquer the levels with you.

 Impulse 100 creates 4 bots.

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
Make a new dir in your quake directory. (ie c:\quake\bg)
then move this progs.dat into that directory and copy your
*.cfg from c:\quake\id1 into the same directory.
Then from the c:\quake dir. type:
        quake -game bg

then bind a key to impulse 100

From the console type:
        bind b "impulse 100"

Technical Details
-----------------
Any bugs lemme know please?

STILL NEEDS:
#1------Trying to get the bots score to come up on changelevel or when
                player dies. Cant seem to figure it out.(ie brain fried.)
                If anyone can lend some insight, lemme know.
#2------Ability to walk into water, swim, and walk over cracks
                in floor.
#3------Better roaming AI.
#4------Need to figure out how to change his colors. Random or otherwise.
#5------In Teamplay, Coop, and one player he is pretty useless on any
                level that has cracked floor, stairs, water, etc.
#6------Need to find a way to display the name of the bot who telefrags.
                Doesn't work well. Displays a big blank.

VERSION 1.60:
        Bot now jumps thanks to a very helpfull David Wiedenmann!!!
        Fixed bot death sequence. In single player mode, the death 
                animation would someimtes stop a few frames early.
        Fixed major bug where bots didnt loose their weapons when they
                respawned. Caused infinate ammo and weapons on level.
        Realized I was contradicting myself in the explanation of how to
                install and run this. 
        Bots frags are now displayed when they die.
        Sped up firing of nail guns.
        Slowed down rate of fire for rocket.
        Fixed Ring Of Shadows bug. Now they can't see you if you have it.
                Like it SHOULD have been.

VERSION 1.50:
        In Deathmatch 4 bots with diferent names are created. If they
                die they will respawn in starting positions again.
        In single player or COOP, only one bot is created but is not
                respawned.
        Bots can now be gibbed, with pieces flying everywhere.

VERSION 1.40:
        Not publicly released due to major beta problems.

VERSION 1.30:
        Model is now the player model. He has the same colors as you do.
        Fixed minor sound bug. (ie no sound when he fires.)
        Slightly improved roaming ai.

VERSION 1.25:
        Doesnt look for ammo if he has max ammo already.
        Doesnt look for items if they are hidden or behind a wall.
        Hunts backpacks now.
        Getting closer to displaying bots kills.
                I know what it needs. but quake wont let me do it.
                Need to find a way around it.

VERSION 1.2:
        By Popular Demand:
                Now in COOP or one player, bots only attack monsters.
                In DM attacks everything.
                In teamplay, is on team of creator.
        Tweeked attacking so the bot can hit things above and below him.
        
VERSION 1.1:
        Added more bot recognition throughout game.
                (ie doors, more recognition by monsters)
        Better Spawning:
                In ONE player spawns in players starting position.
                In COOP and DM spawns in random player position.
        Hunts Items if no enemys close enough.
                Gets health if it needs it.
        Other minor fixes.

VERSION 1:
        TM, DM Bot basis.
        Ability to pick up things:
                Weapons
                Ammo
                Health
                Armor
        Chooses weapon from ones it has.
        Hunts all players (including creator)
        Hunts other bots
        Multiple Bots at once. (memory limiting)
        Telefrags
