Quick Notes
-----------

This is a brief section detailing exactly how to install and run The Oak.

The oak0405.zip file should contain these files:

Pak0.pak
Progs.dat
TheOak.txt (this file)

Unzip these files into an appropriate subdirectory under your Quake
directory. For example, unzip them to:

c:\games\quake\theoak

To run The Oak, switch to your Quake directory, and enter at the command
prompt:

quake - game theoak

Quake will now load and you will be ready to play! Bring up the menu by
pressing the Escape key, then choose Multiplayer and then New Game. Select
the Direct Connect option, and then choose OK at the next screen.

Now you can setup the game environment, for example the difficulty level
to play at, the frag/time limits, the map, etc. When you're ready, choose
the Begin Game option.

You will now be in the level and playing... but there won't be any bots there
yet! To "spawn" them, bring down the Console by pressing the ~ key and then
type:

impulse 100

To display the current score, type:

impulse 200


Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

The Oak is a Quake Bot written in QuakeC which simulates a Quake player.
You can play Deathmatch, Co-Operative, and Team games on your own computer. 
The Oak is named after body-building champion Arnold Schwarzenneger and, 
using state of the art combat tactics and brilliant A.I., The Oak promises 
to be one of the best, and toughest Bots around!

Guaranteed not to "cheat", The Oak will provide a challenging opponent or a
superb ally! Teamplay will be supported so that you and a team of bots can
take on another team. Not only will you get immense enjoyment, but you will
also increase your Quake skills too!

Features:	* Intelligent set of Combat tactics.
		* Dynamic Learning ability. The Oak will remember important
		  map locations such as where weapons, health, armour, and
		  other items are.
		* Ability to swim in water.
		* Will examine the map surroundings for secrets and logical
		* paths to follow, for example jumping onto crates or
		  shooting walls.
		* Includes the Terminator skin and a number of WAV sounds.
		* The skin will actually change to show the damage inflicted
		  on the bot.
		* Possibility to include new weapons in future versions.

Well, that's what the FINAL version of The Oak will do. :) Please be aware
that this is the first public beta that we have released. Currently, only
Deathmatch mode is working. You can try the Cooperative or Teamplay modes
but won't find much happening.

Commands include:

IMPULSE 100 - Spawn 4 bots.
IMPULSE 200 - Display the score.

SKILL x - Change skill level (x = 0 to 3, default is 1)

You can "bind" keys to these commands, so that instead of having to bring
down the Console to enter them, you can just press a key. For example:

bind "q" "impulse 200"

will display the scores whenever you press the Q key.
