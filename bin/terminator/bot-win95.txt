 Playing with TERMINATOR under Windows


 TERMINATOR works very well under Linux, but under Windows it can experience
 a lot of problems because:

   
   
Here is how I got TERMINATOR to work for Win95. It might work too under NT,
win98 or anything like this, but I'm not going to test.

Here is my configuration:
  Quake server machine: SERVER  (replace by IP address of your server)
  Quake client machine: CLIENT  (replace by IP address of your client)


 1/ Check that the network is configured correctly 
 
  on client, ping server to see if you're connected correctly:

     ping SERVER

  the server machine must reply to the ping. If it doesn't, fiddle
  with the system until it does.

 2/ Check that the bot can run standalone

  on server, start quake as dedicated server

     quake -dedicated

   
  Now install the bot (bot.exe) in the same directory as Quake (quake.exe)
  on the client machine. Start the bot in automatic mode with:

     bot -auto SERVER

    The bot should connect to the server, appears in the word and 
    starts moving after a few dozen seconds.
     Type "j" on the bot console, and if you see it jump then the
     bot should be working ok.
     Then type "q" on the bot console, and the bot will leave the server.
     Type "q" again (or CTRL-C) to stop the bot.

 2/ Try to use the bot in proxy mode, on the same machine as the Quake client
      
  With the normal quake client, you're going to  connect to the bot, as if
  it were a Quake server. The bot will then  connect to the real Quake server 
  and you'll be playing through the bot.
  
  On the client machine, start the bot in proxy mode:

       bot SERVER
    
    Type "i" under the bot console. It should reply with some
    "Game informations" (number of connected players, map played...).
    If it doesn't reply, then something is wrong: probably you Quake
    server isn't running, or is using a different port.
    
    If all is ok, start the Quake client by clicking on q95.bat
    Go to console, and type:
     
       connect 127.0.0.1

    If you're lucky, the quake client will print "Trying... Trying..."
    then "Connection accepted." and the game will start.
    If you're not lucky enough to have a working reverse DNS service, the
    Quake client will lock-up for 2 minutes, but then the game will start.
    If you're out of luck, or using Winquake, the Quake client will probably
    print "Trying... Trying again... No response from server" and the game
    will never start. That's rather common under Windows, and never happens
    under Linux. See below for the Winquake fix.
    
    
  3/ Play in proxy mode with the bot on a different machine than the Quake client
    
   Actually, I propose to run the bot on the quake server machine.
 
   On the server, start the Quake server with:
   
     quake -dedicated
    
   On the server, start the bot with:
    
     bot -port 26001

     As usual, type "i" on the bot console, to check that it is connected
     correctly to the server.

   On the client, get a windows console and start Winquake with:

    winquake -port 26001
    
     Then bring down the quake console and type:
     
    connect SERVER

 You should connect to the server through the bot. There will probably
 be a two minutes delay at game start, with the quake client saying
  "Trying..." and apparently sleeping. Don't worry about this and wait
  until the game starts.


 4/ What if the server is a remote machine?    

  You may want to use a third machine just for the bot (a 486 will do),
  if you don't own the quake server, or cannot run anything on it.
  It's even simpler to do. Let's call this third machine MYBOT
  
  On the machine, MYBOT, start the bot with
  
   bot SERVER      (replace by IP address of the server)
    
   Once again, type "i" on the bot console to check the the server replies.


 On the client machine, start the quake server by clicking on winquake.exe
 or q95.bat.
 Then bring down the console and type
 
   connect MYBOT    (replace by IP address of the machine MYBOT)
   
 You will probably experience some delay at game start, just as mentionned 
 above. Don't worry and wait: you're under windows, so waiting is normal.
 
 
 5/ What if all you have is Winquake ?
 
  I experimented a lot of time with Winquake, and after trying many ridiculous
  solutions (like going through two bots on two different machines) I found some
  kind of trick to get it to run. It might work for you.
  
   Start the bot with:
   
    bot SERVER -port 26001
   
   Then start the quake client as usual (do NOT try quake -port 26001)
 
   Once it's started, bring down the menu Multiplayer | Join a Game | TCP/IP.
 
   There, select the bot that contains the UDP port number (26000), and enter 26001
   instead. 
   
   Now, select the box where you must type the name of the server, and
   instead of the name of the real quake server, enter the main IP address of your
   machine... Do NOT enter localhost or 127.0.0.1, it will not work.
   
   To find out the main IP address of your machine, use the tool winipcfg.exe
   that is provided with Windows (Menu Start | Execute | type winipcfg.exe).
   - if you have a network card, enter the IP address that you gave to this card
   - if you have a modem (PPP link), and it's currently connected, then enter 
     the IP address that was attributed to you on the PPP link.
   - if all you have is a standalone machine without network connectivity...
     well you can reach your quake server, so why bother?
   
   Once you've selected the right port and the right address, connect as usual.
   The Quake client should connect to the bot, which in turn will connect to
   the real Quake server, and it should run.

 
 6/ What if none of the above work?
 
  Install Linux RedHat 5.x (or Debian Linux), and say good bye to Windows.
  Linux is the game platform of the future, and it runs Quake like magic.

 ----- Appendix: Playing Terminator and Quake under windows 95 a nightmare -----
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Here are some reasons why you will experience problems under Windows 95.
 I suspect the same is true of Windows 98.
  
  - The task scheduler of windows 95 is deficient, even for 32bit applications.
   When both Winquake and the Terminator bot are running together, only one
   of them actually runs at a decent speed. When playing in proxy mode, this
   can cause a lag time of SEVERAL DOZEN secondes (who said your 14.4 modem
   was slow? lag ever hardly reach 800ms on a modem).
   Though funny to watch, this is not very useful. 
 
 - The name service of Windows is completely broken, if no name servers are
   available on your network (i.e. if you're not connected to the Internet).
   Apparently, it tries to contact DNS service even if not connected, and
   this can cause applications to hang for about 2 minutes.
   What's worse, DOS Quake and Winquake make a reverse DNS query on the
   address of the server when the game starts. This is completely useless,
   and since reverse DNS is often ill configured, the 2 minutes lockup if
   often unavoidable.
 
 - If you have both a modem (PPP link) and a network card, then there are chances 
   that Windows mixup it routes, and tries to contact your PPP Gateway or DNS 
   server by sending packets on the LAN. Bound to fail, and waste time.
  
 - Windows constantly broadcast packets on UDP port 137 and 138, because of
   the SMB protocol. This can slow machines on your local network. You should
   disable all shared drives. Moreover, windows lets Quake broadcast with Ip 
   address 255.255.255.255, regardless of the LAN's broadcast address.
   
 - Some Quake versions are broken. 1.01, 1.06 and 1.09 work, but
   1.07 has a bug, and I didn't get good results with 1.08.
   You'd better upgrade to Quake 1.09, or keep DOS Quake 1.06.
   
 - Winquake seems to be especially broken, or especially unable to deal with
   anything non standard. In particular, it refuses to talk to a bot situated
   on the same machine, if using port 26000. But it will accept for port
   26001, which makes little sense.
   
 - Last remark: QuakeWorld, Quake and Quake2 are totally different, net-wise.
   Terminator only works for Quake. Don't ask about the others.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
     
   
   
 
    

     and if it gives you some info
    about the server, then it's configured correctly.

  Now start the quake client on machine2 and on the console type:
   connect 127.0.0.1

  As if you wanted to connect to a server called 127.0.0.1 (or
 localhost) which is in fact the bot itself.
  If you manage to connect to that server, you will be actually
  playing, through the bot, on the server situated on machine1.
  Do not connect directly to the server machine1.

 That's the way I do it, when I play under win95. 
 But actually, it works much better under Linux (and you can get
 the server, the client and the bot to run on the same machine).
