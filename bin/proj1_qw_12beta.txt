         proj1_qv_12beta.zip  -  QUAKE Project1 for QuakeWorld v 1.2 beta


Okay. It's my QUAKE Project1 for QuakeWorld v1.2beta 
Way beta? Cause I don't have QuakeWorld client software. If You have -
 please test it and mail me.

    Dozens of QuakeC patches in one. Deathmatch code completely rewritten!

=============================================================================
    New weapons: BFG and Throwing Axes (with several new features).
    Exploding backpacks (lots of features and effects).
    Drop/Trade backpacks feature for deathmatch/teamplay.
    All powerups can be switched ON/OFF.
    MultiSkin 1.1 (with Dead body MultiSkin!).
    Rockets/Nails/etc. can pass through teleports.
    There are several blood effects with dead bodies - blood trails when you 
    walk/run over someone, and when you kill someone in the water they float 
    to the top leaving a blood trail.
    Weapons are more like in DOOM - SSG's powered up significantly. Rockets 
    slowed down. All weapon critically pretuned - lot's hours of net playtesting.
    Game speeded up, etc.
    "Deathmatch 3", "deathmatch 69", "teamplay 2" added.
    Observer mode.
    Nails ricochet from walls.
    You can edit deathmatch maps "on the fly" - during the game (Admin mode).

    Many new cool sounds.
    Lots of other effects and features.
    You can switch off several parts of Project1.
    You can disable all external models/sounds - for running Project1 server
     in Internet.
