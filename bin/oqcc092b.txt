Description:             


This is a combination patch of the various patches which I've listed
in the above credit list, and some that i created myself.

If you find any bug (This is the beta version) please let me kmow
mail me at Dukenuker@Geocities.com

If one of you on the credits list are reading this now and don´t want me to use
the code you created, Fine i can remove it if thats what you want.
just let me know ok.

    How to Install the Patch      


goto Quake dir
make a sub dir named "xxxxx"
"xxxxx" can be anything you want
unzip the zip file with -d into the "xxxxx" dir
run quake with the -game "xxxxx" option

Example:

C:\>cd games

C:\games>cd quake

C:\games\Quake>md "xxxxx"

C:\games\Quake>cd "xxxxx"

C:\games\Quake\"xxxxx">pkunzip -d oqcc092b.zip

C:\games\Quake\"xxxxx">cd ..

C:\games\Quake>Quake -game "xxxxx" *

* If you want to you can create a batch file
then this will be alot more easy to do

If you're running Oqcc under Windows 95, and have more than 8 MB of ram,
try to run Quake with this command :

C:\games\Quake>Quake -game "xxxxx" -winmem "xx"

(If you have more than 16 MB of ram, replace "xx" with something bigger)

I am sorry to say this, but if you dont have a least 10 MB ram
I cant recomend you to use this patch.
