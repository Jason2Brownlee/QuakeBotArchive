บ  Description of the Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ
        This bot is diffrent the others, not because it is better...because
there are some better bots out there (Though this one is pretty good). Because
I spent A LONG time adding in other QuakeC add-ons into it. I am still working
on it though. Currently it has SuperAxe (Which the Bots use) throwing flame
-axe, flame thrower, chasecam, multiskin, laser sight, and Eject. I also
have included some skins.
        This bot is also a clan of its own (I know, a clan bot?) Its name is
"The Butchers". They specialize in the Axe! I WILL included there clan Hall,
as a level that I made. (Not all that great, sorry) It includes there grave
yard, there registration area, there arena, and there maze. Try it out! I
have also included the skins for the clan. The offical one is the red and
grey guy. I also included some heads. Some of the heads will match the bodys
, others are just cool or funny. 
        Some of the features include

* Will use the super axe when you get to close

* Fully strafeing and dodges missles

* FlameThrower, Bots will also use it!

* Does not cheat 

* Swims

* Will no longer shoot at you if something is in the way

* Bodys will now stay around after they die

* Creates a bot Randomly so you don't always fight the same one

* The bots talk to you!!! (Real sound)

* More advanced navagtion from BG

* Laser Gun also added

* Has a new weapon "FireAxe" that will burn your apponents down

* Comes with eject built in!

* Good aim, but still possable to dodge

* Can help you in One Player as well

* Read the follow section for more info on ejected shells.

* Helmet lite, it better in dark places but then you are easier to spot!

* ChaseCam and its components (HUD system, Laser Sight, MultiSkin)

* Will no longer shoot at you if there is something in the way

* There leader "Burn" is a better and stronger bot

* Will now swim up if in water

* LaserGun now included

        The last bot was HUGE because of the new MDL files. So I took out
all of them except the ones that were needed. So if you want the new mdls
(Which I think are pretty cool) please e-mail me or Specter. There were
also some problems downloading it so I have now zipped it with winZip instead
of pkzip. I hope that will fix it. There is now the possibility of turning
off eject, so now you don't have to restart a level if it packet over flows.
There was a bug I forgot about (Huh-huh great!) which makes it so you
can't change levels in single player. That is now fixed. The changing to
axe thing has been fixed. Some better roaming, but still working on it...
I now added the LaserGun. Thanks to Khan Reaper for the richoshaing nails
code, and the flameThrower mdl. There was a big problem, the nail gun
didn't work in my last upload, because I was working on the bounceing nails
thing. That was fixed. I am having a bit of trouble with the source code,
after deleting it by a mistake I had to decompile it with proqcc which makes
it compilable but not very readable. I have managed to restore all files but
the BOTAI.QC one, which is the most important. I would think that it should
work when I try to take parts from an old file and past it over the messed up
one but the compiler then gives me a "unknown punctuation" at the last line of
the code that is blank.

บ  How to use Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

Make a directory in Quake (Type MD RBOT) called "Rbot". Copy the ZIP
file into it, and unzip it. Make another directory inside RBOT called
"progs" (It must be called progs.) Copy the player.mdl file into it.
Then make another directory inside Rbot called sound. Type copy *.wav sound
Then goto the quake directory and type "Quake -game Rbot"
.It should run.
Impulse 100 creates 1 Random Bot.
Impulse 103 Goes into observer mode ("Must type KILL to get out")
Impulse 101 Is the score
Impulse 130 turn eject on/off
Impulse 30 ChaseCam
Impulse 20 HelmLight
Impulse 31 LaserSight
