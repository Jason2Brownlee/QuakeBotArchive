KALQuake (v0.8beta) Source Code

(October 25, 1996) - 5:54 PM

To all whom this may concern:

To use this patch, there is only one way to go:  get the Quake-C compiler
(qccdos.exe for DOS, or qccwin32 for Win95) and compile this code into a
file called progs.dat.  Then, place the new file into a new directory in
your Quake directory like so -

		quake -game <dir>

where <dir> is the name of the directory where you placed the file progs.dat.

This is a work-in-progress server patch.  I am compiling all of my favorite
mods (that can be combined) into one patch for servers to use.  So far,
patches used include the following:

bombs8.zip - contains modified grenade launcher and rocket launcher!

tele.zip - allows for placing a personal teleport destination to return
           to at any time from anywhere (except another level).  Also,
           has a teleport bomb which detonates then moves the user to
           its former location.

grap109b.zip - Grappling Hook...no further explanation needed!
	(NOTE: No longer uses the new graphics, instead it uses
	graphics which come with Quake!)

rdi.zip - Random Deathmatch Items (!)

feign_v9.zip - Allows players to 'feign death'...

tracbeam.zip - Allows players to use the ThunderBolt as a Tractor Beam
	as well as the Lightning Gun!

wisp.zip - Your own personal Quake Bot!  The wisp is a special friend...treat
it kindly.  Learn it...read wisp.txt for more info!

Read the read me files included in this ZIP file for each one to learn more
about these great patches!  :)

Additional modifications which do not have an associated .ZIP file:

	Grenades, nails, rockets, etc. now travel through teleporters.

Additions in the near future:

 I will modify the 'gibgun' in bombs8.zip to allow it to 'home in' on
 its targets!  I will also modify Proximity Mine to do less damage.

 I will add the ability for proectiles, gibs, etc. to travel through
 teleporters.  (Done!)


At the moment, this is a very stable patch, but if I add something (or
*you* add something) it might become unstable and not work properly.  For
this matter, I take no responsibility for anything going wrong while you
use this patch (modified or not).  I also will not take responsibility for
you misusing this patch on your server (ie. not telling people about the
teleport patch).

One last word...I do not know who made these patches (I am sure their names
are in the respective read me files from each patch and possibly in the code
too, but I copied all code over verbatim, so names in the code are intact),
but they are great patches and I look forward to more good ones.  The source
code is in the .ZIP file in the \src directory.  I recommend getting WinZip
to view and edit the contents of the .ZIP file...

I plan on combining this code (in some way) with the 3wave 'Capture the Flag'
code sometime in the future.  If you feel like you can handle this task, please
do so and send me the new source as I would be happy to test it out!
