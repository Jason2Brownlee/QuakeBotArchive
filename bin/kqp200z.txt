บ  Description of the Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

This is a combination patch of the varies patches which I've listed
in the above credit list, as well as many other original patches created
by myself.

I've tried my best to make sure they all work well together, and if they
don't, please let me know by writing to me at howard@mortimer.com

I've given full credits to all the authors of the varies patches that
I've compiled into KQP, without their cool work, KQP would never even
exists.

The first time I played Quake with the cool patches, I was impressed on
the cool stuffs that you could do with Quake C. I've tried dozens of
patches created by others, and can never get enough from them.

Then I came up with a new idea. What if I want to use a weapon from this
patch to toast a new object from that patch? So I start to dig up the
sources code of the varies patches that I've, and try to combine them
together.

There are many hot patches out there, and I just can't combine all of
them into one, so I'll have to decide on which to take, and which not to.

If you liked the patch, great, let me know, and tell me what other patches
you want me to put into the package.

บ  How to Install the Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

goto Quake dir
make a sub dir named something like KILLER
unzip everything with -d into that sub dir
run quake with the -game option

Examples:

C:\>cd quake

C:\Quake>md KILLER

C:\Quake>cd KILLER

C:\Quake\KILLER>unzip -d KILLER

... unzip files ...

C:\Quake\KILLER>cd ..

C:\Quake>Quake -game KILLER

If you're running KQP under Windows 95, and have more than 8 MB of ram,
try to run Quake with this command :

C:\Quake>Quake -game KILLER -winmem 12

(If you have more than 16 MB of ram, replace 12 with something bigger)

*********************************************************************

* For those who have only 8MB ram *
===================================

Goto the killer directory, rename the file :

8M_RAM.pak

to

pak1.pak

Then it COULD work... barely. All multiskin features will NOT be
supported, but the rest should work fine.

I strongly recommend you to upgrade to at least 16 MB ram, it'll be the
best 30 bucks you have ever spent!

*********************************************************************

Also, since many people asked me how to install and run KQP, I've created
three batch files to help those who can't start KQP properly. Simply copy
those batch files from the KQP directory to the quake directory, and
run them.

Examples:

C:\>cd quake

C:\Quake>cd KILLER

C:\Quake\KILLER>copy *.bat C:\Quake

3 file(s) copied.

C:\Quake\KILLER>cd ..

C:\Quake>WINKQP killer          <- run KQP under Win95

C:\Quake>DOSKQP killer          <- run KQP under DOS

C:\Quake>SERVER killer          <- run KQP as a dedicated server

That's it.

บ  How to use Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

I've included the text files from the varies patches that I've combined,
and put them into the /TXT directory, so you could look at them and see
what the commands are, as well as the authors' email addresses.
==========================================================================

 For Cujo and Zeus bots, please refer to the following impulse command
summary to learn how to command them.

 In single player game, you can summon Cujo to help you anytime you wanted,
but in DM games, you'll first need to pick up a yellow armor before you
could summon a cujo to help you.

 In single player game, you can summon up to 10 Helper Zeus bots to help you,
or up to 10 Opponent Zeus bots to fight with you as well, just keep in mind
the absolutely maximum number of Zeus bots allowed at a time is 10.

 In DM games, however, you'll first need to pick up a red armor before you
could summon a Helper Zeus bots to help you.

 Helper Zeus bots will NOT respawn in both single and DM games, while
Opponent Zeus bots will respawn only in DM games.

 To set the skill level of opponent bots (all Helper bots are set to
skill 3, with a red armor), goto the console and enter SKILL X, where
X is 1 to 3.

==========================================================================

 Press 8 (or impulse 8) a several times to scroll through the varies
lightning gun weapons, press 7 (or impulse 7) to scroll through the varies
missile weapons, press 6 (or impulse 6) to scroll through the varies
grenade weapons, press 5 (or impulse 6) to scroll through the varies
super nailgun weapons, press 4 (or impulse 4) to scroll through the varies
nailgun weapons, press 3 (or impulse 3) to scroll through the varies
super shotgun weapons, press 2 (or impulse 2) to scroll through the varies
shotgun weapons and press 1 (or impulse 1) to scroll through the varies
type of axes.

Axe weapons :
=============

 Super axe does damage according to enemy's health. The formula is :
If your health < 20, then you'll gib your enemy, as well as yourself.
If enemy health >= 30, then damage is enemy health * 80%
If enemy health < 30, > 20, then damage is 40, normal death.
If enemy health <= 20, then damage is 80, and gib the enemy.
However, you'll also take 20% of the damage you made on your enemy
as well, so be careful when you use it.

Hint : With this formular, basically you could gib anyone even with full
health with 2 swings. Play with it and see the blood and fresh fly around.

------------------

 Vampire axe does 15 damage to the enemy each swing, and give it back
to you. Extremely useful when you're low on health.

------------------

 Finally, I've spent the time to add the eagerly awaited grappling hook
a.k.a. grappling morning star to KQP. I hope it works the way it should
be, and please, "Mike" should be taken the full credit, not me. He'd
created such a cool patch that everyone wants. Press '1' a several times
to switch to it, or Impulse 32 to switch to it instantly.

Hint : Try to pull out a magnum when you've hooked someone. It's a blast.

Note : Since the original morning star will create TONS of gibs when
it's hooked to any corpse, I've made some changes so that it'll do
more damage to corpses and gib them faster. This will reduce the amount
of overhead in multiplayer games, especially over the Internet.

------------------

 A new throwing flaming axe is added. Unlike the other similar burning
axe patches, this one uses the fire 3D model as used in Blaze gun, so
when you hit someone with it, see the fire spread. In fact, even an idle
flaming axe can burn up people! Press 1 (or impulse 1) a several times to
switch to it, or simple enter "Impulse 33" for it.

Note : After your axe is thrown away and you didn't pick it up, it'll
be automatically returned to you after it's been idle for 10 seconds,
or you can pick others' axes up if you see one, as well as backpacks.

Also, When you throw away your axe, you will have NO axe left to use,
so if your axe is the last weapon you have, then after your had thrown it
away, you'll be left with NO weapon! So use with extreme care.

Lastly, when you're hooked to something (like a wall or ceiling), you can't
throw away your flaming axe, but it is STILL a flaming axe, so everything
that you chop will still caught on fire.

------------------

 If you have seen the TV series : Xena - Warrior Princess, you'll notice
Xena has a very cool weapon, her disc.

I've re-create this weapon, once it's fired, it'll bounce off walls and
so on for a while before it'll be returned to you automatically. If you
hit the attack button again once you've fired the disc, it'll start to
return to you right away.

Since it can bounce off walls, it's very useful when it's fired into a
small room. Just watch it bounces and slices through your opponents.
The Disc does damage according to its velocity, so the faster it
bounces off a wall, the more damage it'll make.

The very neat feature about this Disc is that it could actually
*** LOP SOMEONE'S HEAD OFF *** . Yep, just aim close to your opponent's
neck/head area, and see their head flies off if you have done enough damage.

I've also added a new idea, you can now use the disc to
*** SLICE SOMEONE INTO TWO HALVES*** . YEP, just AIM to the middle of
your opponent and see their body splits into two if you've done enough
damage.

I've also included more realistic body parts that you can see flying off
from gibbed players. The skin of the body parts actually MATCHES with the
player's one.

Shotgun weapons :
=================

 Auto-shotgun shoots out 5 shots continuously before stopping for reload.
It's reloading time, however, is slightly longer than the DB shotgun.

------------------

 The Portal gun is a weapon that once fired upon any solid surface, will
open a portal that allow one to WALK THROUGH.

This "weapon", or should I say equipment, gathers warp energy from its
surrounding, and when enough warp power has been charged, it'll fire
a beam of warp energy upon the solid surface you're facing.

If the surface you're firing at is not solid, (e.g. a door, or a openable
wall, other movable objects, etc), the warp energy cannot focus and
it will fail to open up a portal.

Otherwise, you'll see the warp energy focused on a spot, and in a short
moment, depends on the thickness of the wall you've fired the Portal Gun
upon, it'll open up a portal on it.

However, If the wall/surface is too thick or there is no exit on the
other side of the wall/surface, the warp energy will not be strong
enough to penatrate the surface and thus failed to open up a portal.
The warp energy will focus for 5 seconds beforing failing to open the
portal.

Once a portal has been opened, you may be able to pass through it, yet
it the exit of the portal is blocked by some other solid object (e.g
another surfact at an angle), you still cannot get through. An opened
portal can last for 10 seconds.

Once you've fired the portal gun, you'll need to wait for it to recharge
its warp power before you can use it again. Moreover, you cannot open
more than one portal at a time.

 Note, you can still switch to the portal gun when you're out of shells.

 Press 2 (or impulse 2) several times to select it, or enter Impulse
41 to activate it.

------------------

 Magnum Lite, takes 10 ammos, powerful enough to gib someone miles away.

 Press 2 (or impulse 2) several times to select it, or enter Impulse
42 to activate it.

 Poisoned arrows, take one shell per shot, are capable of poisoning others.
The more arrows stuck into a body, the more serious the poisoning effect
will be. Also when the arrows are aimed at your opponent's head, it will
give double damage. Ideal sniper weapon.

 The longer you hold onto the arrow, the faster it'll shoot out, and
it'll hurt even more when it stuck on your opponent.

 Once a poisoned arrow have been stucked onto your opponent, he/she
will start to feel the poison effect from the arrow for a while, and
in fact, you can actually SEE the stuck arrow moves with its victim!

 Press 2 (or impulse 2) several times to select it, or enter Impulse
43 to activate it.

------------------

 Added Air Fist, a famous weapon used to repel incoming missiles or
blow people/item away.

 Press 2 (or impulse 2) several times to select it, or enter Impulse
44 to activate it.

==========================================================================

Super Shotgun weapons :
=======================

 A new chain gun has been added to KQP. This gatling gun will fire bullets
out at an incredicable rate, eject lots of bullet shells and will leave
bullet holes on walls. If the gun is kept firing for a long enough period
of time, it'll get overheat, the gun burrels will turn red, then hot red,
smoke start to come out from the gun, and fire rate will drop. Time to
let it cool down. |8^)

 It uses shells as ammo, so it is more accessable than nailguns. Press 3
(or impulse 3) several times to select it, or enter Impulse 45 to activate
it.

------------------

 Mini cannon, although it may look just like yet another rapid firing weapon,
yet it is capable of doing something that NONE other weapons mod can ever
do, that is, to SHOOT THROUGH WALLS with ** DIRECT HIT **.

 Yep, unlike the rail gun mod, this weapon DOES NOT fire projectiles, it
fire DIRECT HIT bullets like the gatling gun I've done in KQP, but even
better, those direct hit bullets CAN ACTUALLY SHOOT THROUGH WALLS!

 As soon as you fire the mini cannon, you'll see sparks appear on the wall
you're firing at (or blood from your poor friend), but it would not just
stop there, it'll keep on going, THROUGH WALLS, THROUGH BODIES and just
about everything else.

 Since this weapon is a DIRECT HIT weapon, you don't have to wait for the
projectile to actually travel through space to gib your opponent, whenever
you hit the fire button, a straight line from your gun point is drawn to
the very far end of the direction you're pointing at, and the bullet will
strike through anything that sit on that line of attack.

 Also when you hit someone with the mini cannon, you'll knock him back a
bit at a time, so if you managed to keep on firing on the same person,
you MAY be able to paralyze him and add his soul to your ever growing
frag list. |8^)

 The only disadvantage of this weapon I could think of is that it has
a slow reload rate, each time you stopped firing at your opponent, you'll
have to wait until the lits on the side of the gun turns blue before
you can fire again.

 It uses shells as ammo, so it is more accessable than nailguns. Press 3
(or impulse 3) several times to select it, or enter Impulse 45 to activate
it.

==========================================================================

Nailgun weapons :
=================

 I've recently added a new weapon from Jonathan E. Wright (Cujo author)
called Blaze Gun to KQP. It's a really cool weapon, kinda like the
destructor weapon in Duck 2D, but much better. You can caught people on
fire with this, and it's not a sprite anymore, it's a model. Try it out.
Press 4 (or Impulse 4) several times to switch to it, or simply enter
Impulse 70 for it.

==========================================================================

Super Nailgun weapons :
=======================

 Yet another new weapon is added - Rapid Fireball Launcher. Like Blaze
gun, its fireballs can torch up anything in sight, but it's 2 times faster
and shoot in a straight line. A new gun model is used as well. Press 5
(or impulse 5) a few times to switch to it, or simply enter Impulse 80
for it.

Note : In the current setup, pressing '5' will only center the screen,
press the keypad '+' instead to switch to super nailgun/RFL. You can change
this by binding the 5 key to something else, e.g.:
BIND '5' 'impulse xx'

------------------

 Now laser is one of the super nailgun weapons, and new laser missile and
a new laser gun model is also added. To switch to laser, press 5 (or
impulse 5) several times, or enter "impulse 81" to switch to it instantly.

 Laser can cause different level of damage to your opponents, depends on
how long it keeps burning them. Sometimes it can gib an enemy on impact,
someimes it can kill them in a second by keep burning them, sometimes it
takes more than 2 hits to kill one. Each shot now takes 2 cells, 
so keep an eye on your ammo before you run out of them.

 The laser in KQP 2.00Z have been modified so that it will bounces off walls
for 2 times before dying out. Also, laser no longer works under water, but
this is the only projectile weapon that isn't affected by the Air Fist.

------------------

 New color is added for the laser model, and you could select a color
of your choice by entering Impulse 150 (next) and 151 (previous).

Note : Since the laser is more accessible now, it will do less damage then
the old version, but it'll fire 2 times as fast.

==========================================================================

Grenade weapons :
=================

 Ladies and gentlemen, here it is, a REAL flamethrower. The all new
Blazethrower will eat the old, sprite-based flamethrower's heart out.
The flames it throws follows a a ballistic path, and burn up almost
ANYTHING. What if you missed the person you tried to burn, and landed
the flame onto the floor? NO PROBLEM, it'll keep on burning ON THE FLOOR
for the next few seconds, and if some unlucky folk is stupid enough to
walk on that burning floor, he/she WILL catch on fire as well!

That's right! Just like the Blaze gun, the flame created by the Blazethrower
can actually SPREAD! So, wanna create a wall of fire? NO PROBLEM! To use it,
press 6 (or impulse 6) a several times, or enter impulse 54 to switch to it.

Note : The blaze from the blazethrower and other blaze weapons will burn
out after a few seconds, so it won't be too unfair if there is no water
in a particular level.

------------------

 Another new invention! If this freezethrower is release as a seperate
patch (which I'm going to), it'll beat all its competitions! Just read what
it can do :

When you press the fire button, the Freezethrower will not shoot out an
ice beam directly, instead, it'll start to charge up (it consumes rocket
fuel and convert it into a sub-zero beam of ice), the longer you pressed
on the button (or key), the more enery will be charged. (You can actually
see it when it charges up!)

When it's ready, release the button, and see the ice beam flies. As soon
as it hits something, it'll do a RADIUS damage (except yourself), freeze
up ALL SURROUNDING enemies. So the longer you charge the gun up, the more
damage it'll make, and the wider the radius will be.

However, like in Duck 2D, you can't freeze anything before you bring its
health down to like 20. So, keep charging your weapon, and release it
only at the best time.

Also, if you shoot the ice beam into water or slime, it'll INSTANTLY freeze
up all surrounding enemies under water, INCLUDING YOURSELF. Depends on how
much power you've charged, you could possibly freeze up everyone under water
and pick them up one by one later.

The Freezethrower will consume at most 20 rockets at a time, and it will
need at least 2 rockets to work. While you're charging the Freezethrower,
you cannot switch to another weapon, and if you're out of ammo (less than
2 rockets), it'll stop charging, but it won't fire until you release the
button.

To use it, press 6 (or impulse 6) a several times, or simply enter
impulse 55 for it. Try it, you'll love it!

Note : I've also added a new option to allow the freezethrower to
continuously shoot out ice beam without charging, i.e. the chain fire mode.
To toggle between each mode, enter impulse 131. The chain fire mode will
allow the player to fire a continuous stream of ice beam shots, however,
these ice beams are weaker, consumes a bit more ammo than the charger,
and will not do a radius damage.

------------------

 Radio Tag Pipe bombs are like the pipe bombs in Duck 2D, except if it
is not tagged to an object, it'll self-destruct in a period of time.
To detonate, enter IMPULSE 120, to disarm, enter IMPULSE 121.

------------------

 Proximity mine will stick to the walls you shoot at, and will arm itself
after approximately 2 seconds. It'll beep and explode if anyone approaches
the mine within 1-2 meter. To detonate, enter IMPULSE 122, to disarm,
enter IMPULSE 123. Excellent anti-camper weapon. Now modified so that
now only 5 mines are allowed per player at a time, and it now cost 5 ammo
to fire one.

Also note that now proximity mines can be destoryed by explosion or any kind
of attack, including shotgun fire, so if you see someone had setup a
proximity mine trap, you can destroy them by blowing them up.

------------------

 Timed Nuke takes 20 ammo for each shot, like the proximity mine, it'll
stick to the wall you shoot at. It'll arm itself as soon as it hits the
wall, and giving off the 'tick' sound. It will explode after approximate
3-5 seconds. This timed Nuke has a REALLY wide range, so make sure you're
nowhere near it when it explodes, or simply run behind a wall or so.

Hint : Make sure you can't see the timed Nuke when it explodes. If you can
see it, it can gib you, no matter how far it's away from you.

------------------

 I've added a Gib gun mode back by popular demand. Press IMPULSE 135 to
toggle between regular grenade mode and gib gun mode. When activated,
all grenades will be changed to gibs. I hope this will satisfy all you
gib lovers. |8^) By the way, it's not just a clone of the gib gun out there,
mine has more. just watch one of the gib grenade explodes...

Note : Only grenades are converted to gibs, not proximity mines, timed
Nuke, rockets, etc. 

 Also, if you fire a regular rocket in Gib gun mode, it'll work the way
just like the Gibgun patch out there, i.e. it'll enter the victim's body,
and explode after two seconds. If, however, th timing device of the gib
missile have been disturbed by the victim, (doing just anything other
than standing or running), the gib missile will explode on the next
damage the victim gets.

Note : If the victim got attacked while carrying a gib missile, he/she will
explode immediately.

------------------

 Due to populat demand, I've added a nail bome (a.k.a. Eraser bomb) to KQP.
Press 6 (or impulse 6) a several times, or enter impulse 56 to switch to it.

==========================================================================

Missile weapons :
=================

 Guided missile can kill your opponents remotely and very effectively.
Simply fire a guided missile, and control it like flying a plane, but
instead of a plane, you're flying a loaded explosive!

Note : Guided missile, however, can be shot down with any weapon, so when
you see there's a guided missile coming after you, SHOOT IT DOWN!

------------------

 Auto missile launcher shoots rockets out more rapidly, travels faster, but
is less powerful (even weaker than the guide missile, gotta be fair |8^) ).
It'll fire 3 times continuously before stopping for reload.

 In KQP 2.0Z, I've redesign the auto missile weapon model as well as the missile
model. Also, the missile now deploys a "Smart Aiming" device that could help 
you gibbing your victims.

No, it's *NOT* homing missile I'm talking about, it's Smart aiming, and it's not 
the same as the auto-aim in default Quake.

Instead what the Smart missile will do is, once it's been fired, if a 
victim appears within a tight area (20 degrees from where the missile is aiming), 
the missile will start to turn towards the nearest enemy, but NOT chasing after 
him/her.

This is kinda like the missile fired by any Jet fighter, which can't turn 90 
degrees while chasing another jet, but it can only turn slightly at a time, 
so it is still possible to dodge an incoming smart missile.

Since the Smart missile is armed with this aiming device, the amount of explosive 
loaded is therefore reduced, so even though one may be able to fire 3 smart 
missiles in a quick session, unless it's a direct hit, the damage done is MUCH 
less than the damage done by a rocket.

Moreover, if you have notice how the auto missiles work in KQP 1.0, you'll know 
that they are not fired exactly at the point you've aimed, but at an angle 
slight away from it. This feature remains in the smart aiming device, so 
having the smart aiming device will NOT make it into a unfair/too powerful 
weapon, but rather a weapon that require skill to use - with the help of 
the aiming device.

------------------

 Nuke is an area-effective weapon, each shots now takes 30 ammo, but is
uLTRA-POWERFUL. It does have a slow re-load time, and travels slowly, 
however, so use it with extreme care, or you'll be toasted as well.

Hint : Better make sure you're really far away from the target you're
shooting at, and see how the victims explode. This weapon works especially
well when shoots into a crowded room, ideal for ambusing people, thus this
make a good (or not that good?) camper weapon.

------------------

 Flare will lits up an area for around 15 seconds, then it'll die.

------------------

 I've added a Guided Nuke weapon into this killer pack as a special bonus.
These babies cost 40 ammo, and travels like turtle, but you can guide them
to any area you want, and watch people explode from far far away.

Note : As with the Guided Missile, Guided Nuke can also be shot down, but
beware that when you shoot down a guided nuke, you'll also engage the
nuclear reaction in the Nuke, so it'll still have the Nuke explosion effect!

Hint : Guided Nuke is even more powerful than regular Nuke, and have wider
range as well. So you better make sure it IS far away from you before you
hit something. BOOOOOOM!

==========================================================================

Lightning gun weapons :
=======================

 The latest invention from the same author of Cujo and Blaze - BFG 9000.
The all time favorite DOOM weapon of many people, the Quake BFG has a
very similar effect as the DOOM version. To switch to it, press 8
(or impulse 8) a several times, or simply enter "Impulse 90". Read
the associated text file in the \killer\txt directory for more info.

==========================================================================

Misc. weapons :
===============

 To pick up a gibbed head, simply run over it. You can only carry one
at a time. To throw it, enter IMPULSE 12. It'll then turn into a 
homing head missile and floats in the air, waiting to ambush people.

Hint : When it's floating in the air, try to shoot at it using nail 
guns or rockets, and see it bounces away.

 The floating 'homing head' missile have been modified, now the head
you throw out will be the head you've picked up, instead of the
default player's head everytime you throw (now looks cooler). Also if
it hits the ground (either you shoot at the floating head and make
it bounces to the floor (or other surfaces) or it simply lands on
the floor when it is chasing after you), it'll turn back into a
normal head, which you can't pick up again. This head will then be
removed after 10 seconds.

Hint : Use this technique well, and you can avoid many unwanted
deaths. |8^)

------------------

 The new self-destruction mode can be activated by pressing IMPULSE 230,
which is available only when your health is below 20. However, you'll get
a -5 flag if you self destruct, as a penalty, so use it only when you're
in a crowded room.

Note - self-destruction now has a 3-5 seconds delay, so when you see
someone had initialized a self-destruction sequence, RUN!

------------------

 Now backpacks are sometimes trapped. One out of twenty backpacks are
trapped, so during multiplayer game, sometimes you'll get bonus from
people's backpack, sometimes you'll get BOOOOOM!

------------------

 Another new deadly trap - fake backpack bombs are now available. 
Each fake backpack takes 10 rockets, it looks and feels just like the
real backpack, but only when someone pick it up, it'll go BOOOOM!
So, after you'd loot your dead opponent, leave a fake backpack there and
watch others pick it up as if someone has left it behind... BOOOOM!
To throw fake backpack, enter "Impulse 13". It is only available in
deathmatch game only.

------------------

 A very neat feature in C&C : Red Alert if you play the Russian side is
that, you can build MIGs and then call for an air strike upon enemy's
units and structures. An idea stuck me when I was playing C&C : RA the
other day, that I could create an Air Strike patch for Quake that
reproduce the above situation, so I did.

 To call for an air strike, you'll need 60 shells, enter Impulse 190 to
throw a coordinator, once it land on floor, it'll become the target of
the jet fighters to strafe upon. You'll see three F16 Fighting Falcons
fly over the target, one at a time, strafe on the floor while they fly
over the target.

 If any of the fighter spot any thing that moves near the target, it'll
launch its missiles against the target. Each figher carries 2 missiles.

 If you have thrown the coordinator into an invalid location, such as a
gap right next to a wall, the call for the air strike will be cancelled,
and shells will be returned to you upon cancalations of air strike calls.
Each cancelled Falcon will return 20 shells to you, if all three jets are
cancelled, a total of 60 shells will be returned.

------------------

 After I went to see the movie Dante's Peak, a really cool idea strike
me, ie. to implement a rain of fire for Quake, so I did.

 To summon a rain of fire, you'll need 10 rockets, then enter impulse 191
to fire a rune. The rune will stick to the surface it first touches, and
within seconds, it'll summon a fire rain cloud, and fire will start to
rain from the sky like hell. If you hate campers, this is an ideal weapon
against campers.

==========================================================================

Others features :
=================

 Some modifications have been made to the original shell eject code,
a new 'nail' bullet shell model is added, and enhanced the original
texture of the .MDL model. The ejection routine has also been modified
so that the shells are now ejected more randomly, and won't always land
on the same 5 places on the floor. The shell removal procedures is also
modified so that there will always be some shell left on the floor
while won't drag down the system too much or produces too many packet
overflows.  See below for more info.

Hint : Try to goto map e1m8 and play with it. It's like a rain of shells.

 You can turn off shell castings by entering IMPULSE 130. Enter it again
will re-activate the shell ejection.

------------------

 I've added a portable teleporter to KQP as well. Press IMPULSE 140
to memorize current location, and IMPULSE 141 to teleport to the memorized
location. Each teleportation consumes 10 cells, and it is disabled in
deathmatch game when the player is below 50 health. (Or otherwise everyone
teleport away when they're dying.)

 The memorized location will be reset after 5 frags, so people can't always
get back to the memorized location everytime they died.

------------------

 I've added a really cool patch - Chasecam, please read the file included
in the \TXT directory for more info. The impulse command has been changed,
and some functions are taken away since KQP involves too many changes that
those functions will no longer work. Please read the impulse command list
below for the new impulse commands.

------------------

 Added shield for people who want to play defensively. Enter Impulse 160
to toggle the shield, it can protect you from some harm. However, keep in
mind that it is not bullet-proof, and it can't block attacks like explosions.
Also, when you're using the shield, it'll also block anything you're firing,
so use it with extreme caution. Enter Impulse 160 to toggle the shield.

Note : The shield WILL take your cell as a source of energy, and it'll
slowly eat away you cell energy, and when the cell is exhausted, it'll
be deactivated. So please keep an eye on your cell count.

------------------

 Added orb for even cooler defensive/offensive tactics. Once activated,
it'll orbits around you like the Moon does around the Earth. If it spots
any enemy in its sight, and given you have enough cell, it'll automatically
fire beams of laser to the target. Enter Impulse 170 to toggle the orb,
Impulse 171 to deactivate all orbs, and Impulse 172 to switch between modes.

Note - Each orb takes 20 cell to activate, and you can have up to 5 orbs
at a time. Each orb will, however, consumes cells slowly, and if you have
more than 2 orbs at a time, your auto-cell recharge system will not be
able to recharge your cell fast enough, and you cell will eventually
exhaust. And if that happens, orbs will be deactivated automatically.

------------------

 Added a auto-cell recharging system. Now cell will recharge itself slowly
over time, so if you're low on cell, but need to use the laser / orb or
other weapons that use cell, just find a safe place, and let it recharges
itself.

 Cell can only recharge up to 100 cell units (out of 200).

------------------

 Added Feign death to KQP. Enter Impulse 175 to pretend you're death.
Once you do so, you can't do anything like shooting, look around, jumping,
etc. You'll also drop a fake backpack to trick others that
you're really dead, but that backpack is empty, so people may know
something's not right...

Note - I've modified the code so that when your opponent pick up a that
fake backpack when you feign your own death, it'll print false information
about the items in the backpack, although it's empty.

Note - You cannot pickup the empty backpack that you throw when you fake your
own death.

------------------

 Added a throwable eyes (camera) to KQP. Enter Impulse 180 to throw a pair,
and 181 to switch back to player view, thus removing the eyes (camera).

Note - You can keep throwing your eyes (aka the camera) out as many times
as you want, so when you're too far away from your eyes, either switch back
to the player view, or throw another pair of eyes.

------------------

 Added decoys. Pretty straight forward, fire (Impulse 185) as many decoy
activator as you wish (each activator takes 20 cells to fire), and activate
decoys (Impulse 186) from them. You can also detonate all active decoys
(Impulse 187) when you're done.

------------------

 Gibs, gibbed body parts and head now float in water. It's REALLY cool
to gib someone under water now.

------------------

 Added an anti-camping device that will detect if someone is camping.
If the camper doesn't get away in a minute, (there will be a last 10
second warning), the camper will be destroyed.

------------------

 I know all you guys wanted and waited for someone to create a radar,
so I did. This radar is capable of detecting ALL nearby enemy within
a radius, and their position with respects to yours will be shown on
the radar as a colored dot.

The color scheme is as follows :

Red     - the opponent is on the same height level as you do.
Blue    - the opponent is at a higher height level than you do.
Yellow  - the opponent is at a lower height level than you do.

And the dot position represents :

      in front of you

             |
             |
at your      |      at your
left    -----+----- right
side         |      side
             |
             |

         behind you

 The closer the dot is from the center of the Radar, the nearer your
opponent is away from you, and vice versa.

 Once you've activated a radar, you cannot fire your weapon, switch weapon
(unless you pick up some other weapon), or even enter another impulse
command. All you could do is to toggle the Radar to off before you
could fire/switch you weapon again.

 This is intented to prevent serious slow down of the game since otherwise
everyone will activate the radar FULL TIME and if too many of them
gathered in a crowded place, you COULD run out of edicts and crash the
game.

ศอออออออออออออออออออออผ

Bugs:

 If you're controlling your guide missile when the gibbed head is
heading towards you, it'll not explode on impact.

 If a dog/fiend is frozen while it's leaping, it'll continue to move
once it has landed.

 Freezing a wizard a second time (or more) will not drop it to the
floor.

 Rare bug - sometimes during multiplayer mode, the player's corpse may
disappear when he/she respawn.

 Trying to combine a few more cool patches to make the deathmatch game
looks cooler.

 Wish list (listed accoring to its priority) :
- more weapons to come...

 Send me any comments and patches that you want to see in KQP. I'll
try my best to add them onto the patch.

 Also notice that, since KQP is getting bigger and bigger now, the original
qcc compile will NOT be able to generate a playable progs.dat, (more info
follows), in order to compile a playable progs.dat, get the latest fastqcc
from Jonathan Roy (he'd actually compiled this special version of fastqcc
for me - and KQP!), which can be obtained at :
http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/spider/u6m1/QC/fastqcc.zip

Info : During compilation of KQP, I've found that the pr_numglobals has
exceed 16k, which is define in qcc.h as MAX_REGS, and for some time,
KQP simply screws up everything in Quake. So I contact Jonathan Roy,
and asked him to recompile his fastqcc for me with a larger MAX_REGS, and he
did, in fact, now the MAX_REGS is 64k, and I think it'll take me some time
to fill that up! |8^)
