Many thanks to ID for this superb game.


Please let me know of any bugs you find. The only one I can see at
the moment which occurs very rarely is when you kill a bot and collect
its backpack, you seem to get 3 weapons. How ?

Trying to get bots frags to come up on main scores list ?

Trying to get bots to be effected by lava and water ?

Trying to add a new console command, so clients can request
a list of weapons/impulses

Also does anyone know how to add gibbable bodies, like in the dropdead
patch.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------

UPDATE: Grappling Hook Added - Toggle weapon 1 or IMPULSE 21 or 'E'
Walk around on ceilings and areas never seen, snipe from
high up, or just hang on the roof and wait for an enemy to
walk by.

Bots now use the Homing Missile Launcher.
Onscreen message informs all of missiles current target.

Nuke Grenage added, collect 20 grenades / rockets, press
'G' or 'IMPULSE 90' and BOOM (kills all in the area - huge area)

Various death messages added

Several bug fixes

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------

Combines:-

Deathmatch Bots (max of 12 - depending on edicts)
Comrade Bots (AI is a bit lame)
Start with Shotguns, but dont let these guys
get Homing Rocket Launchers or Armour, they are tough.
when they kill you your frag will -1
so you can keep track of score.
Bots can jump
Bots frags are displayed when they die


Tractor Beam (Lightning gun changes mode)
Pipebomb (weapon 6 toggles)
Prox Mines (weapon 7 toggles)
Ammo needed for prox mines & pipebombs - 5 grenades
Texture for grenade can be changed (invisible mines!)
Timed Grenades for normal launcher
(type Temp1 x (x is time) at console)

Nuke Grenades - Wipe out an entire team!

Zombies on walls can be gibbed

Electro Bomb (throw into water, 5 secs, fried enemies)

Laser rifle (replaces shotgun)
Tough weapon, but it eats shotgun ammo.
When used in combination with Quad Damage
fires tons of lasers.

Lightbomb
Throw this a room and watch'em run for the exit
Blinds all in prox for 15 seconds, easy targets! (not bots)

Extra Gibs
Twice as much gore, Three times as much
on Shamber & Fiend

Power Axe
Twice as strong as before, actually worth using
when you have ammo!

Sticky Homing Missiles
Home in to enemy, sticks up arse, then blows up after approx 3 secs
watch the smoke trails as they run! (COOL)

Give a Backpack
Face your team mate and press T (impulse 55)

Foot steps for deathmatch

Flame Thrower (weapon 5 toggles)
NOTE: You have to have the Super Nail Rifle & Grenade Launcher
(both these combine to give flame thrower)

Uses rocket fuel, works on players, monsters
but not bots (metal)

If your on fire, jump into some water

Grappling Hook (weapon 1 toggles / IMPULSE 21 or 'E')
Aim at a wall or roof and hold down fire, the chain will pull you
towards your target. Fire it at enemies and watch there insides go
outside.
