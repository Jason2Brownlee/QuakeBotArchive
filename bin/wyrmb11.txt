บ  Description of the Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ
This is my first patch in Quake C. Making it I have learned a lot of this
powerful language (thanx John Carmack!!).
This is a Quake recompilation patch. Nearly all code has been modified by me,
in order to join and enhance them, and I think that the result isn't bad :).
In this beta version there is only 1 skin avaiable (the one that comes with
severed players patch), so you can use it with only 8 megabytes of RAM and
it's smaller to download ^^;. In the final version there will be 15, at least.

บ  How to Install the Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ
Who doesn't know this??
Simply go to Quake dir, make a subdirectory, copy the pak file into it, and
run quake with:
quake -game <name of the directory>
You can add "-winmem 16" if you have Win 95, but it works fine with 8, I think.

บ  How to use Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ
I've included the text files from the varies patches that I've combined,
and compressed them into TEXT.ZIP, so you could look at them and see
what the commands are, as well as the authors' email addresses.

Weapons recollection:
--------------------
-Super shotgun: if you get it and you don't have mossberg, you get it.
else, if you don't have the double-barrelled shotgun, you get it,
and if you have the other two, you get the assault shotgun.
-Nailgun:First you will get the MP5, and after the M16.
-Super nailgun: first the freezethrower, after the flamethrower, and after
the plasma gun.
-Rocket launcher: first you will get regular missiles, after guided, and
after homing.
-Lightning gun: first the lightning gun, after the Positron Beam, and after
the Proton Storm.

Impulse 1 weapons:
-----------------
* K-bar knife: a Navy Seal weapon :). it doesn't do so much damage, but it's
very fast and have a probability to chop enemies.
*Axe of Command: it has been modified, so you can shot to your minions.
This weapon can chop, too.
*Throwing Axe: I have modified it, so you can hold it for a while and when you
release it, the axe will move more fast, and will do more damage.
Other chopping weapon ;).
*Morning Star: the tipical be-in-all-patches weapon. Very cool.
*Hand grenade: another weapon from Navy Seal patch. The explosion is one of
the coolest things i see in Quake. It's useful if you don't have weapons that
use rockets.

Impulse 2 weapons:
-----------------
Note: all three weapons are from Navy Seal patch.I modified them a little, so
they have automatic reload, aiming and cool particles when fired to a wall :)

*Colt M16 Assault Rifle: Good at long and short distance. Have a 30 bullets
clip.
*MP5 Sub Machine Gun: it fires more fast, but do less damage per bullet. It
also have a 50 bullets clip.
*Mk23 Handgun: Very good at short range, but bad at a long one. It has a
12 bullets clip.

Impulse 3 weapons:
-----------------
*Assault Shotgun: ANOTHER weapon from Navy Seal. It's like an automatic
shotgun, and consumes shells very fast.
*Double-barrelled Shotgun:Cool model from Deft. It has a long reload time,but
do 140 damage at once!! :)
*Mossberg 590 tactical shotgun: Oh! another from Navy Seal!. It's good to
save ammo, and for medium ranges.

Impulse 4 weapons:
-----------------
*Airfist: Is one of the coolest weapons ever made. It doesn't need comments :)
*Tripbombs: These tripbombs are very close to Duke ones...

Impulse 5 weapons:
-----------------
*Freezethrower: It's the one from Ice Ion patch, but nearly all rewritten!!
Now , ice bounce at walls, and it can... freeze the water!!!
*Flamethrower: the code is from Quake Command, but with a cool 3d model as a
flame, and a more cool weapon model from PAIN. When it burns someone, the fire
is like Blaze Gun.
*Plasma Gun: it seems like a 3-d version of DooM plasma...

Impulse 6 weapons:
-----------------
*Normal Grenades: well... they are... normal??
*Bouncer Grenades: they throw spikes when explode
*Cluster Grenades: when it explode, it throws a lot of normal grenades.
*Poison Grenades: it makes a cloud of poison gas that will poison your
enemies.

Impulse 7 weapons:
-----------------
*Normal Missiles: ...
*Guided Missiles: they cost 2 rockets, and you can seek and hunt your enemy
with it.:)
*Homing Missiles: as above, but the missile will make it for you.

Impulse 8 weapons:
-----------------
*Lightning Gun: the typical... no changes :PPPP
*Positron Beam:It cost 20 cells, but it has a bunch of damage. It can kill a
Shambler with one shot.
*Proton Storm: Cost 50 cells, and it ANIHILATES all... I had to put a fix in
order to stop it killing Shub with one shot :)))

Impulse 10 weapons:
-----------------
*Chainsaw: Well... it inflicts tons of damage and chop your enemies into
little pieces... what more can you ask for??
*Bucky ball gun: it has two modes -normal and flare-. The first will launch a
ball that will make an explosion every time it touch floor, and the other
burn everithing it touch.

Teamplay and Deathmatch:
-----------------------
New Teamplay Modes:
* Teamplay = 4 - IT
  The player who is IT is Red.  Everyone else is Blue.  Players killing IT
  will get 3 frags instead of 1.  When IT kills someone, he gets no frags but
  his victim becomes IT.
* Teamplay = 5 - TI  
  The player who is TI is Red.  Everyone else is Blue.  When TI kills a player
  he gets 3 frags instead of 1.  When someone else kills TI, they become TI.
* Teamplay = 6 - Quake-TI
  The player who is TI is Red.  Everyone else is Blue.  TI gets quake power
  in proportion to the number of people in the game.  8 People means TI does 8
  times normal damage.  When someone kills TI, they become TI and get 3 frags
  instead of 1.
* Teamplay = 7 - Capture the Flag 
  The game is divided into teams of Silver and Gold (pant colors 0 and 1).The
  first person to join each team gets the flag and base.  The game begins once
  both teams have placed their bases (impulse 18).  The goal is to get the other
  team's flag and bring it to your base.  Once this is done, the player who
  captured the flag gets 10 frags, and everyone on his team gets 5 frags.Flags
  can be dropped by using impulse 18.
* Teamplay = 8 - King of the Hill
  In this game, the only way to get frags is the be "King of the Hill".  At the
  start of the game, someone uses impulse 18 to place the Hill.  Any player
  close enough to the Hill will gain 0.1 frags/second.

New Deathmatch modes(only two):
* Deathmatch = 3
  Is simply a deathmatch with monsters. Try it with skill =3D 3!!!!
* Deathmatch = 4
  It's very stupid. A deathmatch with NOTHING. I think it's only useful with
  "temp1 81" in order to get a faster game.

Monster enhancements:
--------------------
I don't want Wyrm to be an only deathmatch compilation. I want also to enhance
single player game experience. To do this, I added some stuff...
-Grunts have different weapons (double-barrelled grunt can kill you with one
shot!)
-Ogres fire missiles if they are far enough from you.
-Enemies respawn in nightmare!! (now it will be really a NIGHTMARE! he he)
-Ogre, knights and hell knights can chop you  :)
-New type of Enforcer!!! from Navy Seal patch. Completely new model!!
-Added cranked. See cranked.txt for more details.
-Scrags fire much more :)

Map information:
---------------
-Added suport for Rain from QuakeX
-Added suport for explowalls (func_explo_wall)
-You can place "weapon_plasma_gun" and "weapon_chainsaw" in your maps.
-New things you can place:
	"monster_army_single"   \
        "monster_army_double"   ณ
        "monster_army_nails"    ณ- test "grunt.bsp"
        "monster_army_plasma"   ณ
	"monster_army_fire"     /
	"monster_wizard_normal"
	"monster_wizard_hell"
	"item_jetpack"
	"weapon_plasma_gun"     - test "plasma.bsp"
	and more to come!! ;)

บ  Testing Notes  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออผ
All Quake standard maps seems to run properly.
If you have Quake 1.06, there is an all-patches problem. Game will crash
if you load a certain number of maps... I think it's caused by the new
models... if you have Quake 1.08 you won't get this error.

Normally, I test it with 16 Mb of RAM, but it seems to run well with 8 Mb.
Maps included:
      GRUNT.BSP---->simple 5 grunts of different type.
      PLASMA.BSP--->only a weapon of plasma on the screen.
      EXPLOW.BSP--->an example of what can you do with exploding walls.
      RAINTEST.BSP->rain from QuakeX
      CHAINSAW.BSP->chainsaw test map. Hey !! the enforcer is COOL!!!

ษออออออป
บ Bugs บ
ศออออออผ
Hummmmmmmm... I have not tested it in GL-Quake... if you have it, please,
test it (specially the plasma) and send me the result..
-If you freeze a scrag two times, it will not fall out the second time.
-When burning, if you use the jetpack, game could crash with a D_CheckCacheGuard
fail.
