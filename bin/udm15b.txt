thanks     server space for UDM.

Big      : ID Software <-- Without them, there'll be no quake...when there's no quake, this MOD wouldn't be here :)
Thanks

Beta     : Raymond Siah and Nicholas Chia (a.k.a Sohlican). I need more beta testers ! Especially those who have GlQuake.
Testers

Notice   : Ultimate Devastation MOD requires Quake version 1.08, if you run it on anything lower than that,
           you may encounter weird results. Get Quake Version 1.08 at UDM's official site as listed at the end of this readme.
           UDM works on GL Quake as well at least at the moment. Looks great though :)
           Don't forget to delete your meshes directory (glquake) before running glquake after every new version of UDM has been released.
           Besides that, delete opengl32.dll or rename it if you face problems running UDM under glquake (crashes for example)
           Also make sure that you run quake with the -zone 2048 parameter or else it will crash with an error message.

Build time : Approximately 3 - 5 months.

* Indicates new feature or weapon since UDM 1.5

Notice: If you already have a weapon, picking it up again once it respawns will not give you anything. This is to avoid
        camping in a way. That means say if you have the rocket launcher, when it respawns and you still have it in your
        inventory, you can't pick it up. As for the super shotgun, you can only pick it up twice the most to get two shotguns
        for dual super shotguns. This is NOT reflected in deathmatch 2 or deathmatch 3 modes.

Reminder: If you want to set a bot skill, please make sure you disable random bot skills first before attempting to change the
          bot skill through the console. Type randomskill at the console to enable/disable bot random skill. After setting the
          bot skill, restart the map and start fragging.

Changes Since UDM 1.5
---------------------
- Removed Lag Simulator

General Changes
---------------
- If there is some time left in your quad damage or ring of shadows and you get killed, it'll drop just like a backpack.-
- Health boxes are now doubled !
- Default maximum health is now set to 150, you will start with 100 health but can heal up to 150 health maximum UNLESS you pick up a megahealth.
- weapons will now switch to "explosive" weapons such as grenade launcher and rocket launcher once a certain weapon goes out of ammo.
  as opposite to what has been mentioned in the quake manual.
- Radar - Bleeps and points to closest enemy. A beam of electricity shoots out towards the closest enemy showing their direction.
        - The bleep will get stronger as the enemy gets closer to you.

Improvements Since Version 1.5
------------------------------
- Better weights for ammunition.
- Bot model will now yaw like a real player would i.e : if a bot is standing a level higher than his enemy on a map like dm4,
  an if the bot fires the shaft down towards his enemy below, the bot model will show the bot pointing towards the enemy. Originally,
  the bot model only pointed straight and that was quite limited as it cannot point towards the enemy whether up or down.
  This was a feature that Steven Polge originally planned to add before he went to work at Epic.
- The reaper bot will now be able to use the wind tunnel properly on maps such as jexdm1, bassness, etc...

Bugs fixed Since Version 1.5
----------------------------
- Fixed a bug with the previous weapon stuff, if you selet a weapon using it's direct impulse (i.e plasma) and try to use the "+bfg" (for example) in a
  script, it will refuse to switch back to the old weapon. It's fixed now.

Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
This MOD basically combines the reaper bot and enhances the gameplay with the bots by fixing all the bugs that Steven Polge has left out
such as the thud sounds, jumping bugs, etc. Also included are some new "toys" to play with and bits and pieces of coding have been taken
from here and there to create this MOD. The main sounds and graphics of this MOD are from the Quake Classic MOD.

Note: This MOD does not work for single player quake, it works only for multiplayer OR botmatch only (against BOTS that is).

Some of the new weapons include :

Airfist (1)                        - Deflect incoming rockets, grenades or nails.  Blast players or objects across the room.  Also a great way to launch yourself up and over obstacles!
                                     (note: objects moved by AirFist blasts will eventually respawn in their original respawn positions)
Chainsaw (1)                       - You should know how this baby works by now, it's of course much better than an axe but makes a lot of noise when you select it. Has a cool internal
                                     and external model view as well as sounds. Internal model and sounds taken from WYRM mod and external view model from Zerstï¿½rer.
Grappling Hook (1)                 - The weapon that came from CTF is now at your disposal.
Laser Gun (2)                      - This baby can radiate or toast your foes, deadly in close-range battles. Uses cells to fire.
Twin Double-Barrelled Shotguns (3) - Double the fun with two super shotguns, increases the fire radius.
Mini Cannon (3)                    - Another one of my favourite weapons, this baby can fire through walls with direct hit and not only that you can see holes on the walls/ceiling/floors or on almost anything that is non-living.
                                     Uses up a lot of shells, so i'd recommend storing lots of shells and then fire at one go - it's fragtastic ! To get this weapon, you MUST pickup the super shotgun first. Then you press "3" to select the mini cannon.
Pulse Rifle (4)                    - This version of the regular Nailgun shoots much higher velocity
                                     nails. Therefore the projectiles will ricochet off any non-living
                                     surface.  This specialized gun is perfect for shooting targets
                                     around corners or behind you.  Skilled marksmen can do some
                                     really impressive stuff with this gun.
Gatling Gun (5)                    - The gatling gun fires quick direct shot nails that can waste your enemy quick much like the minigun but even more powerful. However, it takes 4 nails per shot.
Proximity Gun (6)                  - As the name suggests, this weapon will fire proximity bombs that stick on anything that is not alive and will detonate upon contact with it.
Cluster Grenade Launcher (6)       - Once fired, the grenade will explode into 5 mini grenades like a grenade fountain. (From Quake Mission Pack 2)
Homing Rocket Launcher (7)         - A rocket that can track your enemy, but it is possible to avoid this rocket by running :)
Multi Rocket Launcher (7)          - Fires 4 rockets that are spread out. (From Quake Mission Pack 2)
Rocket Pods (7)                    - Fires a burst of rocket pods fast in random directions, can be very deadly sometimes especially with quad damage in a room full of bots or players. Takes up one rocket for each rocket pod, but requires at least 5 rockets before you can select the weapon.
Shrapnel Launcher (7)              - The shrapnel launcher fires 4 flaming rockets that can bounce off any inanimate objects and upon contact with a human or bot, it will burn him. The only way to get rid of the flames is to get an armor or get into water. Uses 4 rockets to fire.
Chain Lightning Gun (8)            - My favourite weapon, the chain lightning gun chains the enemy you target with other enemies close by. (Model and coding from Zerstï¿½rer and sounds from PainKeep MOD)
Plasma Gun (8)                     - Beefed up version of the thunderbolt, this weapon fires a deadly plasma bolt capable of chaining entities nearby. Chews up 10 cells per shot, be careful with this weapon !
Positron Beam (8)                  - This baby is an antimatter weapon that will produce a huge explosion that can easily frag a couple of guys with it. Careful though, the radius is big enough to blow yourself up. Chews up a hefty 20 cells :)
Mjolnir (9)                        - The mjolnir, THOR's warhammer - it can spread from one victim to another like the chain lightning gun.
Twin Laser Cannon (9)              - This weapon emits a series of laser blasts that disintegrate anything in its path and has the ability to bounce off any inanimate objects at least once.
BFG 9000 (0)                       - If you've played Doom, you should know what this baby does. Turn a room packed with people into gibs quick. Not guarenteed to gib everyone though but it has quite a large radius :)
Devastator (0)                     - This baby is the weapon from Duke Nukem 3d and can wreck a lot of havoc with it's firing speed. Fires two rockets at the same time per side.

Note: The numbers indicate the weapon number to tap to select these new weapons, for example press 3 twice when you get two super shotguns to select the twin double-barrelled shotgun.
      You will automaticly get the new weapons when you pick up the corresponding weapon number i.e : picking up the rocket launcher will give you the homing rocket launcher and multi rocket launcher.
      For the Mjolnir, you will get it when you pick up the new Mjolnir weapon taken from the Hipnotic Mission Pack. To get the mini cannon, pick up a super shotgun. As for the Twin Laser cannon, you
      need to pick up the Laser Cannon weapon just like picking up a Mjolnir. This rule applies the same for the BFG 9000, picking it up will give you that weapon.
      Pick up the rocket launcher to get a devastator as well.

Soon-to-be-added weapons (subject to change) :
Railgun (need to find a suitable model), and probably others :)

Runes Description
-----------------
Runes can change the balance of the game, but it adds more fun to it, here are the 4 types of runes:

Earth Magic - Owner will be able to resist any damage by two times.
Black Magic - Do two times the amount of damage to any living being.
Hell Magic - Haste. Speeds up your firing times.
Elder Magic - Regenerates your health & armor.
Heaven Magic - Regenerates your ammo ! Nifty rune i should say :)
Ignorance Rune - Powerups and runes won't work on you once you pickup this rune.
Reflection Rune - Wearing this rune will reflect any projectiles that touches you !
                  Very neat, but you're not all superman yet, beam type of weapons, nailguns and normal shotguns can still kill you.

Once you pick up a rune, you cannot pick up another. If you'd prefer the other rune, you must first drop your rune by typing droprune in the console.
When you die, your rune will drop like backpacks and weapons.

Maps Included
-------------
Armageddon 1, 2 and 3 by Matthias Worch and Broken Hope by Moloch.
Just type arma1 / arma2 / arma3 / infect in the console to load the map.

Future Enhancements:
- More weapons (drunken missiles, etc)
- Option to change grenade explosion / detonation timing (maybe)
- Other stuff that i can think of :)

These new weapons include new models and sounds as well. The bots will use the weapons as well, randomly.

Note: You can type in both the alias or the console commands onto the console to activate a specific option/command.

Configuring Ultimate Devastation MOD
------------------------------------
This is a new and unique feature of UDM, whereby you can configure which settings you want and set it permanently such as
the weapon auto switching, shells ejection, etc can be set by editing udm.cfg.
Just edit udm.cfg using a normal text editor and change the temp1 value accordingly. You must add the values together if you
want to disable and or enable certain features at the same time. Say you want to disable both shell ejection and weapon auto switching,
just place in the temp1 value of 24 as 8 + 16 = 24 ! You may only add OR subtract the values, no division or multiplication is required :)
Simple? Easy peasy.

By default the temp1 value will be 3687680, with random items and weapon respawning style 2 & random powerups style 2, full armor at start, etc,
and all the rest of the features are enabled, so it's up to you to set them to your liking.

Known Bugs
----------
- game may crash on certain maps and this requires you to restart your computer unless you're playing UDM on ms-dos prompt in windows environment.
- too many bots and frags may cause a lot of packet overflows, but it should stop after awhile.
- no free edicts error message may pop up , but happens normally when there's too many entities in the game. (gibs, shell casings, etc)
  spawning less bots will help, especially when playing deathmatch 4 or deathmatch 6.
- Chasecam may jam once in a while, unsure what causes this to happen.
- i had to disable the CheckReboundAttack routine as this routine causes problems to the plasma's firing routine, so you might see the bots "getting bored with life"
  once in a while or even "tries to put the pin back in"...unless i can come up with an idea on how to fix this.
- 8 meg ram users may experience jerky gameplay with the new Visible weapons model as they have skins as well and this takes longer to load up.

Utilities Used
--------------
- Quake Army Knife for copy and paste skins job and adding new skins to the Visible Weapon models.
- Adquedit for replacing skins that have been added using Quake Army Knife.
- Pak Explorer for packing and extracting purposes.
- Proqcc for decompiling purposes (used to use this for compiling as well).
- Fastqcc for compiling purposes (very useful).
- Edit.com for quake c :)
- Standard dos pkzip to zip up udm into a zip file :)
- My brain :)

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

Extract the zip archive to your quake\udm directory (you may extract it to another folder if you want to but
if you do so, you must edit udm.bat / winudm.bat to reflect the -game udm directory, rename udm to the directory where you have installed udm).
After extracting, copy the file "udm.bat" in the directory that you have extracted, to the main
quake directory. To play Ultimate Devastation MOD, just run the file udm.bat from your quake directory.
If you have winquake, copy the file winudm.bat instead to your quake directory and run it.
GlQuake users should use gludm.bat instead.
