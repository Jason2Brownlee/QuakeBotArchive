Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
Changes since version 1.03:  Updated for Quake 1.06.
Can now have up to four single player bots (may have
some bugs still, one bot is still best).  Still no
bot grenades or lightning.  Have only received a handful
of comments about previous revs, so just the progs.dat
this time.

Impulse 100 creates a single (non-deathmatch), or four
(deathmatch) bot(s). There is no way provided to get
rid of the DM bots except by filling them with holes.
2nd-4th single player bots may be added by subsequent
impulse 100's.  After that they start disappearing.
5th thru 8th DM bots are added by a 2nd impulse 100 (DM).
The 2nd set of DM bots are "clones" of the first four,
and have radio telemetry equipment to signal to the other
twin during combat.  They do tend to gang up on opponents...

The Holo is assigned to impulse 50, but since it still
doesn't fool bots, it's not really useful.  Multiskin is
the usual impulse 200/201.

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
Make a new dir in your quake directory (ie: c:\quake\swimbot).
Put progs.dat in the new dir.  Make sure you have player.mdl
and shelcase.mdl in the 'c:\quake\swimbot\progs\' subdir; and
shellhit.wav in 'c:\quake\swimbot\sound\weapons\' subdir
(batteries not included).

Bind a key to impulse 100 to activate the bot;
Run quake, with your normal parameters plus:
<...> quake <...> -game swimbot <+map ...>

For the single player mode, I enter "teamplay 1<cr>" at the
console.  For some reason the menu teamplay mode doesn't
tame the bots.  I still have not tested the bot in cooperative
mode yet (anyone else tried it?).

Technical Details
-----------------
Trying to create more than 8 DM bots will get you to
the console.  I gotta find a way to shrink the .dat
file!  Report any bugs you may find.

Author Information
------------------
This is my first effort, but I've also got some ideas
for a level.  Unemployed, so got plenty of time...
