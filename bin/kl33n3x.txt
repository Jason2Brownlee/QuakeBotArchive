How to use Kl33n3x, to ease your headache and mine.
---------------------------------------------------------------

start by launching the kl33n3x program. move your cursor over the
dos box and do not open QuakeWorld until the busy cursor goes away.

now open QuakeWorld. a fault in kl33n3x is that it stops listening
for a -connect server command after a short time, to make sure this
doesn't happen, before anything else in QW, type "-connect ip:port"
without qoutes and replace ip:port with the numerical server address
(i.e. 192.168.123.69) AND THE PORT (default is 27500). So the full
line should look like this:
	-connect 192.168.123.69:27500
then press enter. it'll say something like "invalid command" or the
like.  Now type "connect localhost" (without quotes) and press enter.
what this does is connect QW to the proxy (kl33n3x). instead of typing
the -connect string now, jes press up twice and there it is, press enter
and kl33n3x should connect to the server. if not close BOTH kl33n3x and
QW and try again.

i've included a sample script (kl33n3x.cfg) that controls the autoaim.
this is what is there:

	alias +autoaim "say -aim f"
	alias -autoaim "say -aim s"
	bind space "+autoaim"

before playing around with aliases to your liking, remember to but "say"
before any proxy commands, kl33n3x moniters the say command and intercepts
the commands for it (i.e. "-aim f" will not be broadcast to the server).
here are the basic commands:

	-aim [1-31] = the bot give each person a number, u can specifically
		 lock onto that person. (i.e. if i was 5, -aim 5 would lock
		 onto just me) the assigned number lasts the entire match,
		 when u lock onto the person nearest to you, the bot
		 echo "Tracking: [#]". jes find the person (sniper :P) u want
		 and remember that number :)

	-aim f = locks onto the nearst person in front of you

	-aim n = locks onto the nearst person (that person could be behind
		 you, below you, etc)

	-aim s = deactivates the lock on the targeted player

	-f = the built in "FPS Enhancement." -f followed by eight, spaced,
		 single digit numbers change the options. the features are
		 as follows: (these only effect YOU)

			+Explosions: Normal, Tarbaby, Teleport, Blood, Nothing, Shotgun
			  Changes the explosion sprite to the new effect
			+Powerup Glow: Normal, Own Off, All Off
			  Own off turns off your glowing effect when u have the quad, etc.
			  All off removes the glowing effect from other players carring an item
			+Muzzle Flash: Normal, Remove Own, Remove All
			  When u fire your weapons, the end glows depicting the fire discharge,
			  you can remove seeing it
			+Gib/Bodies: -
			  Doesn't Change anything
			+Rockets: -
			  Doesn't Change anything
			+Setinfo: Not Supported
			+Nails: All, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4
			  How many nails u see coming at you
			+Damage Flash: On, Off
			  i.e. when your on fire, thats damage flash




did i loose ya? if so, stop reading! now, each of those is given a number (all start at 0)
so the default string is "-f 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0" if u understand this, u understand the system.
"-f 1" would move the 'Explosions' value up one to 'Tarbaby'. "-f 2" would change 'Explosions'
to 'Teleport'. etc, thats all i'm gonna explain. if u don't get it, tough.

NOTE: After the Nails option it says "Not SupportedAll" this is a typo the author made, the Nails
option is in fact supported.

well, this is the kl33n3x proxy. its not great but it has it's uses. hope this text is useful
(if not SCREW YOU!!) enjoy kl33n3x
