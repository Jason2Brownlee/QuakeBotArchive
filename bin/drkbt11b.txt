How to Install the Modification

make a subdirectory darkbot in your quake directory
copy pak0.pak into the directory darkbot you just made

How to Use the Modification
---------------------------
NOTE: you also need a drkpkXXX.zip file where XXX is any version number

Single Player:
Follow instructions for listen server 

Listen Server: 
Please use Quake -game darkbot -listen 16 + temp1 34         
this spawns 3 bule and 4 red level respawning bots

Dedicated Server: 
Quake -dedicated {#players + #bots} +temp1 34 +deathmatch 1 +map e1m1
This spawns 3 bule and 4 red level respawning bots in a DM on e1m1.
If you'd like a different password and MOTD email me i'll code it in
and mail you back the new progs.dat.  Please mail me if you run a 
dedicated DarkBOT server

How to be an ADMIN:
If not an observer: impulse 255 - 250 - 251 - 252 - 253        
Else Password: impulse 250 - 251 - 252 - 253	

HINTS: 
---------------
Set fraglimit 50 is a good idea, bots WILL exit levels.
Fraglimit makes it so if you have less frags than fraglimit when you 
  touch the levelchange trigger your telefraged.
You must be an ADMIN to do anything "kewl" no matter what game type.
When you run a dedicated server the bots will play without any humans
  and changelevels themselves 'cause who wants to play e1m1 10 times?
Temp1 can be any number from 0 (no bots) to 66 (6 red, 6 bule).


New for Beta 11b
------------------
Damn annoying bot watermove sound when swimming removed 
 ( CONTENT_EMPTY when bot.waterlevel == 1 )
Annoying no lg discharge in water fixed 
 ( run a watercheck inside weapons like lg )
Added a lg discharge in water at ppl when bot health is low 
The most stable dedicated server id routine yet!

On Deck
-------------------------
Roaming ai? my bot does good without it...with it  =)
Dynamic level mapping
Perhaps a multibot patch with another bot maker?
New skins and new female sounds?

Help me I need it
-------------------------
Please contribute female snd fx!!!
Please report any bugs you see.

All about the lame authour
--------------------------
I coded in ADA C, Fortran, and some basics and serveral 
script languages before this "quake" C. 
I check my box at least every week...

Copyright and Distribution Permissions
--------------------------------------
The original QuakeC source is Copyright 1996, id software.
I'll release source after the code is commented. (next release??)
Scorebroad frag/name and color MSG_UPDATES Alan Kivlin (qcbot).
Female sound fx aren't mine. (listen close...from another game)
Aim skill/waypoints based on code by Drew Davidson (ctfbot).
Drew also gave me the idea to set a bot's waterlevel .float directly
 although he set feet waist and eye levels wrong.  =)
Everything else done by Dark_Skye.
