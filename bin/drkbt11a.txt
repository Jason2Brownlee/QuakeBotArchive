How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
make a subdirectory darkbot in your quake directory
copy pak0.pak into the directory darkbot you just made

How to Use the Modification
---------------------------
NOTE: you also need a drkpkXXX.zip file where XXX is any version number

Single Player:
Follow instructions for listen server 

Listen Server: 
Please use Quake -game darkbot -listen 16 + temp1 34         
this spawns 3 bule and 4 red level respawning bots

Dedicated Server: 
Quake -dedicated {#players + #bots} +temp1 34 +deathmatch 1 +map e1m1
This spawns 3 bule and 4 red level respawning bots in a DM on e1m1.
If you'd like a different password and MOTD email me i'll code it in
and mail you back the new progs.dat.  Please mail me if you run a 
dedicated DarkBOT server

How to be an ADMIN:
If not an observer: impulse 255 - 250 - 251 - 252 - 253        
Else Password: impulse 250 - 251 - 252 - 253	

HINTS: 
---------------
Set fraglimit 50 is a good idea, bots WILL exit levels.

Fraglimit makes it so if you have less frags than fraglimit when you 
  touch the levelchange trigger your telefraged.

You must be an ADMIN to do anything "kewl" no matter what game type.

When you run a dedicated server the bots will play without any humans
  and changelevels.

New for Beta 11a
------------------
_dedicated server is now VERY stable due to new net id sorting
_new menus using impulses 1-10 ( try the bot management one )
_some minor bug fixes
_removed flag use for gender id...it caused a few bugs
_damn annoying bot watermove sound has been axed 
 (Alan set bot.watertype = CONTENT_EMPTY in your bot_postthink)

Help me I need it
-------------------------
Please email me your thoughts on:
would you like to contribute female snd fx or skins?
would you like to contribute code or ideas?
would you like green eggs and ham?

All about the lame authour
--------------------------
I coded in ADA C, Fortran, and some basics and serveral 
script languages before this "quake" C. 
Please email me a bug report or suggestion.... 
I check my box at least every week...

Copyright and Distribution Permissions
--------------------------------------
The original QuakeC source is Copyright 1996, id software.
I'll release source after the code is commented. (next release??)
Scorebroad frag/name and color MSG_UPDATES Alan Kivlin (qcbot).
Female sound fx aren't mine. (listen close...you'll know her)
Aim skill/waypoints based on code by Drew Davidson (ctfbot).
Drew also gave me the idea to set a bot's waterlevel .float directly.
(hey Drew the water check in CTFBOT 1.2 is WRONG man...)
Everything else done by Dark_Skye.

If you would like to see a part of my code email me.
