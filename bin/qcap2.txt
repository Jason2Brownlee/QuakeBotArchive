Name of Mod : QuakeC Add-On Pack
File Name   : qcap2.zip
Version     : This is the second public release and probably the last.
              Although it's pretty much nothing like the first version,
              as I redid almost everything. For the better, of course... :)
	      I also took the vulgar language out. :) "A**" is replaced
              with "Arse" and such. Bots also have individual personalities
              and phrases now...go to the home page for more info, or just
              read everything under "ALL THE IMPORTANT STUFF". :) Although
              the home page contains more updated information.

AUTHOR INFO
-----------
My name is Rich, Rich Whitehouse. Mama always said, stupid is as stupid
does. Would you like a choc--::SMACK BASH BASH:: ::2 men in white clothing
walk up:: "Mr. Whitehouse is author of this patch. He has a small mental
condition that must be supervised at all times, so don't mind us." Help...
me...they're...going...to...kill...m--::PROD PROD ZAP SIZZLE:: "QUIET, BOY!"
Y...yes...sir.

TYPE OF MOD 
-----------
QuakeC   : No, it's only called QuakeC Add-On Pack because it DOESN'T
	   have any QC.
Sound    : Yep
MDL      : Uh huh
Maps     : Nope. Why? Because I suck at level editing.
Graphics : Yup

FORMAT OF QUAKEC
----------------
unified diff  : What's that?
context diff  : Uhhhh...
.qc files     : Nope, see "ALL THE IMPORTANT STUFF" for details.
progs.dat     : No, you have to compile the non-existant QC files on your
                own.

INSTALLATION
------------
Just run the install.bat file and follow the on-screen instructions. When
running Quake with the patch in Windows, you must use -winmem 12 or higher.
I recommend 28 if you want it to go nice and fast. Here's an example of how
you would start Quake with the patch under Windows:

quake.exe -game qcap -winmem 28

That should do it. Contact me if you have any problems. Also, if you do
something really stupid with the install program and make it do something
bad, I'm not responsible. :)

ALL THE IMPORTANT STUFF
-----------------------
Alrighty then...first I need to thank the people I sto--err, borrowed
source code from... ;) Rob Albin is 1 person who definitely deserves
TONS of credit for supplying the source code for the grappling hook and
his very own chasecam. Credit for the multiskin and lasertarget things
also go to him for supplying the source code. I wrote all the other
stuff from scratch. So, enjoy! Here's the list of impulse commands and
such...Uhhh, oh yeah...I have another person to thank. :) Maniac for
giving me an example of code to use to pull the player towards an entity
(I used it for the magnet, but then I tweaked it a bit to make it pull in
EVERYTHING within the radius). I also learned a TON from that, it's part
of how I made the co-op bot. If I forgot anyone, sorry. If you know of
anyone I should've but didn't thank, please let me know about it and I'll
thank them in the next version. Ummm, oh, also got thank Inside.QC (which
is now Inside 3D and located at http://www.inside3d.com) for providing so
many good tutorials which I learned a lot from. The one I used in this
patch was the sticky bomb one, although I pretty much rewrote the sticky
bombs anyway. :) Since I've made it so you can't decompile the progs.dat
file from this patch, if you see something you would honestly like to learn
from and not just use in your own patch and take credit for, let me know.
I might write a tutorial or something for some of the new weapons if I get
enough requests. Oh, another thing...if you want to port this patch to
QuakeWorld, let me know. I'd like to get it running on a server. Also, if
you have this patch running on a server, let me know. I'll add a server
list to the web site and put your server on it. Make sure you stop by the
web site to see if there are any servers... I would've done a lot more on
this patch had I had more time to work on it and started it earlier. I
might've even been able to make another Reaper. :) But, Quake is old now...
Maybe I'll do something for Quake II. LOOK FOR IT! :)

impulse 20 - Drop a pipebomb.
impulse 21 - Detonate all of your pipebombs.
impulse 22 - Fire a flare.
impulse 50 - Displays status.
impulse 40-45 - Hotkey weapon modification keys.
impulse 30 - Toggle external/internal view.
impulse 31 - Laser target toggle.
impulse 32 - Move down ext. view.
impulse 33 - Move up ext. view.
impulse 34 - Zoom in ext. view.
impulse 35 - Zoom out ext. view.
impulse 200 - Down 1 skin.
impulse 201 - Up 1 skin.
impulse 98 - Throw hook/Release hook.
impulse 96 - Pull in after hooking an object.
impulse 97 - Give the hook some slack.
impulse 150 - Big jump (quite useful in rocket fights :), but requires at
least 25 cells).
impulse 13 OR select the shotgun twice - Select the Laser Rifle.
impulse 14 OR select the rocket launcher twice - Select the NUKE.
impulse 15 OR select the super nailgun twice - Select the Ripple Cannon.
impulse 16 OR select the Grenade Launcher twice - Sticky Bombs.
impulse 17 OR select the Lightning Gun twice - Blow Gun. Shoots an orb
which pushes everything in its path away from it, and causes an explosion
on impact.
impulse 18 OR select the DBSG twice - Harpoon Gun. Shoots a harpoon which
sticks into the wall or an entity and leaves a blood trail if it's stuck in
an entity.
impulse 19 OR select the axe twice - Spear. If a spear hits an entity it
will stick into it and pull it over to you. This weapon is still under
construction, so there is no rope linking the spear tip and you, and it
looks kind of strange...hopefully I'll have that fixed soon.
impulse 23 - Spawn a DeathMatch Bot. DM Bots use whatever skin you're
             using when they're created. Before using a DM or Teamplay
             DM Bot, you should type "deathmatch 1" at the console
             (without the quotation marks) and load the level again.
impulse 25 - Spawn a Co-op Bot. I stayed up all night and drove myself
             insane trying to figure out how to make a co-op bot...
             and I FINALLY DID! :) Of course, that was back when I wasn't
             quite as good with QC. :) I might redo the co-op bots to be
             more like real players, but I think they're ok the way they
             are now...plus I don't feel like redoing them. ;)
impulse 129 - Spawn a Teamplay DeathMatch bot. Well, I've finally done
              it. Now you can play DM, Co-op, AND Teamplay. Isn't that
              special? :) To use Teamplay DM Bots, you must set teamplay
              to 2. Do so by typing "teamplay 2" at the console (without
              quotation marks). Now add Teamplay DM Bots for your side
              and DeathMatch Bots for the other side (they're programmed
              not to kill eachother in teamplay, and if they do, they're
              penalized just like you are if you kill a bot on your team,
              or if a bot is on your team and he kills you or another bot
              on your team).
impulse 123 - Throw a magnet.
impulse 124 - Toggle being drawn to magnet.
impulse 125 - Teleport magnet back to self.
impulse 126 - Gets rid of any magnet within a 500 radius to you. Mainly for
              multiplayer in case someone gets you on their magnet and won't
              let you go...but use it only as a last resort, as it takes
              you down to 50 health, to 25 if you have less than 50 and to 1
              if you have less than 25.
impulse 127 - Toggle weapon kickback on/off. It makes it more realistic in
              my opinion, but it can be quite annoying. :)
impulse 128 - Crouch. Can be used as toggle crouch or button-hold crouch.
              Just type impulse 128 to toggle, or if you want to be able
              to hold a button and crouch then release it and stand up,
              type the following at the console:

              alias +crouch "impulse 128"
              alias -crouch "impulse 128"
              bind ] "+crouch"

              This will make it so that pushing the ] key crouches, and
              releasing it makes you stand up. I'm still working on
              improving this, since there are lots of things wrong with it.
impulse 252 - Find any Teamplay DM Bot within a 250 radius of where you are
              currently standing and make it solid or not solid to you (to
              you ONLY, to every other entity it's still solid). If it's
              already not solid, it will become solid. If it is solid, it
              will become not solid. This is for when the Teamplay DM Bots
              get in your way and won't move. It's pretty annoying, so if
              it happens, just use this.
impulse 253 - This will teleport your most recently created Co-op Bot to
              your current location in the level no matter where you or
              the bot are.
impulse 254 - This sets your viewpoint to your most recently created Co-op
              Bot or Teamplay DM Bot. Use again to set the viewpoint back
              to you.
impulse 250 - This tells Teamplay DM Bots to follow you or leave you alone.
              They follow you by default.
impulse 251 - This takes the message off the screen immediately that comes
              up when you begin (the "Welcome. Please blahblahblah" one :).
impulse 130 - This makes it so that bots don't start out with the DBSG on
	      skill 3. Nifty for if you want a good fair DM against a
              skilled opponent... :)
impulse 249 - Give the last bot you created every weapon and full ammo. This
              is pretty much just for fun. :)
impulse 248 - Show each bot's frags.

New stuff in this version:
Improved hugely on the Co-op Bot's AI, he can now follow you up stairs
and such even when he does not have a target, he also faces you when he
doesn't have a target, rather than constantly staying at an ackward
angle like in the previous version. I also completely rewrote the DM
Bots. They still use the default AI, but they now show a larger difference
with skill level settings (type skill 0 through skill 3 at console to
set skill level, any other skill value will default to skill 1). They also
have a more realistic weapons system (they don't start out with the Rocket
Launcher, DBSG, etc., although they DO start out with the DBSG on skill 3,
just to make it a bit more difficult :). There are also better death
messages (TheFatal1 chews on player's boomstick, player rides TheFatal1's
rocket, etc.), including different messages for all the new weapons. I
added special support for the nailguns and lightning gun. When using them
the DM Bot runs at you at the speed of a normal player (although exact
speed and accuracy depend on what skill level you're playing on). I also
stuck some modifications in the ai.qc file that only have an effect on
the DM Bots. Aside from the improvment on the bots, I've also made it so
the magnet works fine in multiplayer. At least it SHOULD, I haven't tested
it yet myself. I also added the ability to crouch. Wrote all the stuff for
it myself, but I got the idea from the Navy Seals Weapons Patch. I've also
added a "DeathCam"...a bit of a modification on the ChaseCam. Now, when you
die, you get an external view of your body/head. Surprisingly, it took quite
a bit of work to get it to work in multiplayer, but I finally got it working
well. There's also a new weapon, the Blow Gun, and I added the ability to
select all the new weapons via weapon cycling. You can now only use the new
weapons if you have the original weapon which uses the same number (e.g.
to use the Tesla Cannon you must have the Super Nailgun, to use the
Sticky Bombs you must have the Grenade Launcher). I also made it so that
if you select a weapon and only one of the weapons for that number is
out of ammo, it will automatically select the other weapon for that number
(e.g. if you're out of nails and have 25 cells, selecting the Super Nailgun
will automatically select the Tesla Cannon). I also remembered I'd created
the Sticky Bombs with a tutorial a while ago. I couldn't remember who to
thank, and the Sticky Bombs had some bugs in them anyway, so I pretty
much rewrote them. They're better now though, I got rid of the bug which
would cause the sticky bomb to just float in the air if the victim it was
attached to was killed before it went off. Oh, and, of course, I can't
forget the new Teamplay ability of the DM bots. :) Also, I re-did the
shotgun shell MDL (skin and all) since I now have QuakeME 3.0 and because
I felt kind of guilty for taking it from the Alien TC guys. ;) I also added
strafing to the bots and will soon be (hopefully) adding the ability to the
bots to be attracted to items. The bots also go up stairs now with no
problem, and they don't fly anymore (that was HORRIBLY annoying :). Also
added MORE new weapons. :) See the impulse list for what they are. I'm
sure there's stuff I forgot to put on this list of new things, but it's
already long enough. :)

Possible improvements/enhancements in future versions:
This'll probably be the last version, seeing as Quake is getting old and
people are starting to hate it/not like it.

If you have any questions or anything like that, then e-mail me. My

By the way...YOU MAY NOT USE ANYTHING IN THIS ADD-ON IN ANY WAY EXCEPT
TO PLAY IT ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER. YOU MAY NOT MODIFY IT IN ANY WAY, TAKE
CREDIT FOR IT IN ANY WAY OR USE IT AS A BASE FOR YOUR OWN PROJECT OR FOR
ANYTHING ELSE! <grin> Well, except parts of the ChaseCam, hook, etc...you
can use those, because I didn't write them. Although I did make some
modifications to the ChaseCam myself, such as the after death view...so,
uhhh, just be safe and don't use anything from this patch. :) If you DO, and
I find out about it...THEN I'LL MAKE SURE YOU DON'T GET ANY CANDY FOR A
WHOLE MONTH! THAT'S RIGHT MISTER! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR MOM WOULD SAY ABOUT
THAT? SHE'D GROUND YOU FOR 2 WEEKS! THAT'S RIGHT! FURTHERMORE, I--::2 men in
