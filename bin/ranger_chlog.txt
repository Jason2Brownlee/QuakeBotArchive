Work log for the Ranger Bot.

=======================================================================

[www.geocities.com/maleficus666]


Plan:

This is my work log.

Its updated whenever I get around to it and the bot itself.

If I finish something, I'll write an "*" line.

If I find a bug, or find a needed feature and I don't fix/add it, I
make a note of it. Notes may be repeated, until I get around to it.

If I find something that wasn't a good idea, or remove
something, I'll add a "-" line.

= 27*11*01: version 0.6.0a (internal)==================================

 * Improved RL aiming - on higher skill, Ranger understands
   splash damage.

 * Fixed some bugs in his combat movement.

 * Fixed "view angle" bug when you first spawn in arena.

 * Fixed the "fall in spec room, loser armor" bug.

 * Ranger is now a single player game: no more having to remember
   a bunch of settings at startup. To start a game, just use the 
   Single Player Menu. The game is a tourney, RA style: beat 
   Ranger in best of 24 maps!! There is, however, no game saving
   allowed.

 * Server now randomly plays thru the maps, instead of always
   playing in the same order. Helps keep the game more fresh and fun.

 * Misc tweaks and fixes.

 * Cleaned up all of the QC code, and fixed a lot of id's bugs.
   GREATLY reduced the size of the progs.dat file (almost 50%
   savings in file size!).

 * Fixed clipping issues with the new models.

 * Fixed skill 1 VWEP problem.

 * Added the basics for hunting/seeking code - he should be
   harder to shake now more than ever on higher skills.

 * Added a few jokes/secrets to the mod. Good luck finding
   them!! :-P

 * Expanded the bots chatting routines - he'll gloat after
   a victory, or curse after a defeat!

 * Fixed "firing weapons lag" bug! This bugger almost made me throw
   out all my code and start over from scratch again!

 * Ranger now joins you right from the start of the game 
   (in the spectator room), rather than being spawned just 
   before you begin the match (more realistic this way).

 * "Fixed" skill 1 weapon selection - it sucks now more than ever! :-P

 * fixed prob of sounds overlapping at end of game.

 * added intermission music based on your performance.

 * fixed the pain frames animation.



= 21*9*01: version 0.5.0a (internal)===================================

 * Added client-side spin animation to rockets when fired. Uber-kewl!

 - TomazQuake only support is gone. Mod is again normal Quake
   compatiable. Its limiting, but I think its the "Right Thing To Do". 
   May change my mind again later.........

 - Removed scoring system - was tomazquake only, and unstable. Will
   have to add a new one (.6??).

 - Removed the old waypoint system. For now, has no waypoint
   navigation. Will add a better one later (.6??).

 * Adjusted his skill level settings even more - now skill level will
   affect nearly EVERY action of the bot (weapon leading, movement, 
   navigation,  etc). Still needs more work tho.

 * Whenever you hit the bot, it makes a "ding" noise, ala Q3.

 * Fixed/added more debugging tools.

 * All items, weapons, powerups, etc are now removed from the map, 
   meaning, IN THEORY, you could play RA on any map out there in 
   existence.

 * A few new weapon FX/models are in the game now.

 * Some various small tweaks and bugfixes.

 * VISUAL WEAPONS!!!! You can now see the bots weapon. Kudos to the
   "Deathmatch Essentials" team for the base models.

 - "Biker" skin is no longer used for the bot. :'-(

 * Fixed various problems with some of the maps/bot code.

 - removed a bunch of un-needed crap from the code put there by 
   id.

 - streamlined my own code - is now smaller and MUCH better.

 * no more "thumping" when he jumps.

 * improved weapon handling/aiming - again.

 * Basic rocket jumping by the bot in combat.


= 18*9*01: version 0.4.0a (internal) ==================================

 - Cleaned up and rewrote most of the code.
 
 * Added new rewards based on your performance.

 * Added the more RA like countdown before the battle.

 - Fixed some internal QC bugs originally put in the source
   by id (not me for a change change!!)

 * Now prints the name of enemy when your crosshair is on them, ala
   Quake 3 Arena. Useless, but fun.

 * Bot can now be bounced around by weapon hits, just like a player!

 * Bot moves more like a human, and is less jerky.

 * Added skill levels to the bot. Skill 1 is a n00bie. Skill 3 is 
   MUCH more of a challenge.

 * Game won't let you shoot until you enter the arena.



= 25*8*01: version 0.3.0a (distributed) ===============================

 - Disabled Backpack/weapon dropping.
 
 - Took out the powerup checks in the code.
 
 * Created my own RA server code.

 * Bot and human gib easily, for kewl endgame FX.

 - Made it so the "by line" is shown just once.

 * When named "observer", you can't be killed or seen. Only in 
   debug build tho!

 * Fixed the "tie with bot" bug.
 
 * Created a new bot roaming routine.

 * Bot weapon handling is MUCH improved!



= 24*8*01: version 0.2.0a (internal) ==================================

 - Took out the code that would allow you to be hurt by the world. On
   some maps, you would be killed by some object/bug in the map, which
   defeats the purpose of RA. Sadly, you can't die by drowning anymore.

 * Fixed another bug with bot removal command.

 * Added more indepth debug info for internal bot profiling.

 * Fixed buggy bot chat routines.

 * Bots are on Scoreboard.
 
 * Bots can now win games through fraglimit variable.

 * Bots now use custom model as skin.

 * Fixed "stack_overflow" bug!!! This bot may not be the smartest,
   but its probably the most stable bot out there right now - have had
   it running all day with no crashes/lockups.

 * Bot now uses ALL weapons properly.

 * Laid down the basics for a new, better chat routine.

 * Fixed problems with the bot weapon lead and the RL.

 

= 23*8*2001: version 0.1.0a (internal) ================================

 * Bot is officially a Rocket Arena bot. The beginnings of the server
   code is in place.

 * Improved bots handling of weapons, though there is still room
   for improvement.

 * Added bot removal feature. Buggy!

 * Added some basic chat routines (when enters game, killed).
 
 * Added debugger camera feature - to let you see thru the bot's
   eyes. Can also see its weapon, health, ammo, armor, etc.
 
 * QuakeC file access is now working. TQ engine only tho.

 * Improved bots target leading, and fixed its "Reaper bot" like
   aim with the shotgun. Has trouble with RL though.

 * Bot now thinks during pain frames.

 * Bot will now activate plats, but, they dont understand them yet.

 * Fixed the "bot won't die in shallow lava" bug.

 * Fixed the fall into lava and never die bug!! :-)

 * Added developer debugging tools.

 * Added the info_waypoint code to quake so it will parse any
   waypoints in the bsp that it finds.

 * Bot thinks faster now.

 * Improved "Centerprint" function.

 * Added splash when you enter a liquid.

 * Laid down the foundation for a waypoint editor.

 * Slowed down the RL, to be more like Q3A.

 * Added new/funny death messages.

 * Added more blood/gore/gibs to the game.



= 22*8*2001: version 0.0.0 (internal) =================================

 * Original bot.

 * Basic bot frames and movement.

 * Basic AI layout, just smarter than average monster 
   that looks like a player, so far.....

 * Uses RL - only weapon so far.
