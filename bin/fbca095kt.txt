Description
===========
A Quake mod that combines the Frogbot and Clan Arena & Kombat Teams.


Installation
============
Unzip into your Quake folder.


Running the game
================

Create a folder fbca and Unzip into fbca folder.
Create a bat file:
--------- 
@echo off
cd..
\quake\qwsv.exe +gamedir fbca
--------- 
Then start qwcl.exe and incorporate to local server.
For game I recommend to use zquake.exe or fuhquake.exe.
Then write so:
--------- 
@echo off
cd..
\quake\(zquake or funquake).exe +gamedir fbca
--------- 

Important Notes
===============
- Refer to readme.txt and readme012c.txt for more information on the Frogbot.
- Also, this sets sv_gamedir to "arena", so QuakeWorld clients won't have to download sounds if they already have them in their arena folder.
- You can use the reset command instead of reloading the map to change settings such as 'deathmatch' and 'arena'.
- When 'botrj' is enabled, the bots will always try to rocketjump instead of going the long way. If they don't have a rocket launcher, they will just stand there and do nothing. So, I recommend that you only enable this in modes where they will always be able to rocketjump, such as deathmatch 6 or clan arena.
