Many thanks to ID for this superb game.


Please let me know of any bugs you find.  The only one I can see at
the moment which occurs very rarely is when you kill a bot and collect
its backpack, you seem to get the lighning gun ?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE: 
        Backpack bug fixed. (was not resetting ammo)
        Bots can now fire Standard & Homing Rockets.
        Bots Health increased back to 200.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Combines:-

Deathmatch Bots (max of 12 - depending on edicts)
Comrade Bots (AI is a bit lame)
     Start with Shotguns, can collect and use:-
       -Super Shotgun.
       -Nail Gun.
       -Super Nail Rifle.
       -Rockets / Homing Rockets.
       -Armour.
       -Health.
       -Ammo.
     Bots cannot use:-
       -Grenade Launcher. (Will collect)
       -Lightning Gun. (Will collect)
       -Quad.
       -666.
     Bots will squash, but they teleport straight back.
     When they kill you, your frag will -1
     Bots can jump.
     Bots frags are displayed when they die
     Bots are not resistant to lava or slime. (upper body)
     Bots can stay in water for as long as they want.
     Bots self destruct if they run out of ammo. (twice grenade power)
     Bots take on your skin colours.

To CREATE bots, change your net name to SecurE and do an impulse 229.
This makes it harder for people to create bots, as too many would
crash the server. (and there are nasty people out there!)


Tractor Beam (Lightning gun changes mode)

Pipebomb (weapon 6 toggles)

Incendiary Prox Mines  (weapon 7 toggles)
       Ammo needed for prox mines & pipebombs - 5 grenades
       5 secs to arm, experiment with placement.

Texture for grenade can be changed (invisible mines!)

Timed Grenades for normal launcher
     (type Temp1 x  (x is time) at console)

Nuke Grenades - Wipe out an entire team!

Zombies on walls can be gibbed

Electro Bomb (throw into water, 5 secs, fried enemies)

Laser Rifle (replaces shotgun)
     Tough weapon, but it eats shotgun ammo.
     When used in combination with Quad Damage
     fires tons of lasers.

Lightbomb
     Throw this a room and watch'em run for the exit
     Blinds all in prox for 15 seconds, easy targets! (not bots)

Extra Gibs
     Twice as much gore, Three times as much
     on Shamber & Fiend

Power Axe
     Twice as strong as before, actually worth using
     when you have ammo!

Sticky Homing Missiles
     Home in to enemy, sticks up arse, then blows up after approx 3 secs
     watch the smoke trails as they run! (COOL)

Give a Backpack
     Face your team mate and press R (impulse 18)

Flame Thrower (weapon 5 toggles)
    NOTE: You have to have the Super Nail Rifle & Grenade Launcher
           (both these combine to give flame thrower)

    Uses rocket fuel, works on players, monsters, and bots
     
    If your on fire, jump into some water

Grappling Hook (weapon 1 toggles / IMPULSE 12 or 'E')
    Aim at a wall or roof and hold down fire, the chain will pull you
    towards your target.  Fire it at enemies and watch there insides go
    outside.

Server Info (impulse 150 or 'I')
       Requests server info, lists all except impulse 229.
