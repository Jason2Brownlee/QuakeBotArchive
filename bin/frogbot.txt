Here you have it! The best quake dm-bot in existence, custom optimized by
me (Christian "surgeon" Michael). The optimizations are largely the same as
the quakeC modifications in qboost3.

The original progs.dat files are in "original_progs.dat_files".
These are included to avoid violating authors distribution guidelines.

The maps supported in this release are:

dm4

dm6

bless

fribdev1(including the variations fribdev1_2 & fribdev1_3)

rapture1

ztndm1

ztndm2

ztndm3

ztndm4

ztndm5

ztndm6


I must stress that the only work I have done is
to fps-optimize the source (68K friendly) and recompile with extra waypoints.
Unfortunately I had to modify the source extensively, since it's written for
a compiler called preqcc. Faqcc does not handle includes like preqcc,
so I had to disable all of them and make sure, that only the parts relevant
for normal quake was compiled. Enough about my effort.


Credit must go to:


Robert 'Frog' Field - creator of the Frogbot.


and the waypoint authors:

Brian 'EraZoR' Mathiasen
Hylke 'Gibbie' Beck
Jonathan 'Crunchy' Slark
Matt 'Asdf' McChesney
