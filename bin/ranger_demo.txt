Construction
----------------

Build Time            : About 24 hours so far.... no where near being complete!

Editor(s) used        : QCEDIT, QuArK, QME, Nullsoft Install System, FrikQcc, PreQcc. 

Known Bugs            : His skill 1 movement isn't the best yet. Needs some work to be as 
			"natural" and varied as the higher skills are; which were the skill
			levels I worked	on the most. :-/

			NOTE: on skill 1, he'll make various "bad" choices as to his weapons
			as well as his combat tactics. This is NOT a bug! On skill 1: hes
			supposed to be a total n00b - which means he's SUPPOSED to suck. ;-)

Impulses              : Typing "start" in the console starts the game.
			There is also a "fight" key - bound to 'i' that
			does the same thing.


Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

This is just a quick demo that shows the current progress of the Ranger Bot, for Rocket
Arena. There are only 4 maps included with this demo: the start map where you
select at which skill you want to play Ranger, gear8 by Marc Roussel, arenax, 
and Zaphod's "Arena" RA map.

***********PLEASE NOTE:*********************** 

I am releasing this for testing, feedback, and suggestions. If you see something
that needs work, please give a complete description of what the problem was.

If you see something that works, you can pass that along too ;-).

If you can, a demo of the problem/bug you found would be nice too.

Recording a demo in Q1 is a bit different than how it is in Q3.

Heres how to record a demo:

Bring down the console. Type: "record demoname arenazap" -OR- "record demoname gear8"
(depending on which map you want to record the demo on) without the quotes, and press enter.
You can replace the name "demoname" with whatever you would like to call the demo.  
Then, go to the dir where you installed Ranger, and move to the "mal_ra" folder. Inside that
folder will be your demo file (the extension is ".dem").


How to Run the Modification
-------------------------------

Double click on the shortcut "Ranger Bot - DEMO" that is now on your desktop.

When the game loads, and you see the console, hit the "ESC" key in the upper left hand
corner of your keyboard.

Go to "options", to configure your settings and preferences. This is important!

Go to "Multiplayer" then "Setup" to configure your name and colors.

When your ready to play, then Select "Single Player" in the main menu.

A map with 3 hallways will load. You CANNOT play Ranger on this map.

Each hall picks a different level of skill. The one to the left picks "Easy", the middle
"Normal", and the one to the right picks "Hard". Pick whichever one you want to play Ranger
at, then walk thru the teleporter at the end of your chosen hallway.

You'll spawn into a spectator room inside a new map, and Ranger will join you shortly.
You CANNOT fire your weapon in the spec room (nor can Ranger), so just use this time
to get comfortable with your settings/movement, and check out the Arena below.

To begin the game, bring down the console (hitting the "`" key) and type "impulse 100"
without the qoutes; OR just hit the "i" key (if you haven't already bound it for 
a diff function).

The game will countdown, then spawn you into the arena proper, and the match will have begun.

The winner is the last man (or bot) standing.

Good Luck!


Some Basic Tips/Suggestions:
-----------------

Ranger is a VERY jealous bot! Don't try to make 2 Rangers in the game - bad
things might happen! ;-)

Be sure to set your controls BEFORE you play - the default controls aren't the best.

You lose armor, but not health when you Rocket Jump - use this tactic to your advantage:
Ranger will!

Try to use TomazQuake for the demo only (in case you have Dos/Win/GLquake):
TomazQuake is more stable and looks/runs better.

If your having a hard time with Ranger, be sure to change the skill level to suit 
your needs by bringing down the console and typing "skill N", 
where "N" is either 1, 2, or 3.
Ranger will automatically update and adjust his actions to fit the skill level you
choose.

The "i" key is bound by default to be the "Fight" key - if your in the spectator room,
hitting this key will also start the match (and is faster then typing "start" in the
console all the time).

One of the first things you'll prolly want to do, after installing, is set the brightness
in "Setup/Video". TomazQuake defaults to a very dark gamma.

If you try to select a diff map (other than the 4 maps included), it WILL kick you back
to start. FYI: nearly everything not related to Ranger and this demo has been
removed/disabled, so you can't play regular quake with this demo.

When you finish the first arena, it will move to the second arena, then to the third.
After that, it will loop betweent the first, second, and third arenas.

After the match, be sure to check out Ranger's chats by bringing down the console!

Please don't distribute this demo to NON-ASWP members! This demo uses a bit of the
original Quake's resources, and widely distributing it to anyone outside of our 
organization would violate the GPL (i.e. would be BAD!).

There are a few jokes/secrets hidden in Ranger - including one secret mode 
thats really fun! Best of luck in finding them! :-P

When you finish the match (and if you win), the announcer will give you an audio award:
"perfect" if you still have all your health and armor, "excellent" if your health and armor
is over 100, and a plain "you win" otherwise.
