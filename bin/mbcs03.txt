1.0  Copyright

	This code and the accompaning documentation is copyright
1997 Mike Warren. You may not distribute it, sell it or in any 
way make money off it without the written consent of the author.


2.0  Introduction

	This code will allow you to easily create a client-side 
autonomous quake-bot. I do not support the creation of cyborg bots
such as Stooge Bot and Loef Bot (however, Stooge Bot is very well done
and has many safeties to make it "nice". LoefBot is not so well 
behaved).

	There are "TODO" comments throught the AI classes (mbnav, mbfire
and mbtalk) telling you what you need to do to make a working bot. (That
said, however, this code will compile and connect "out of the box" but
will just run at the nearest wall :) )


3.0  Compatability

	I have compiled this code successfully on Windows 95 with 
Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0, SunOS with g++ and CC and AIX 4.1.4 with
xlC. I presume it will compile with Linux since g++ (GNU C++) compiles
it.

	If anyone has problems compiling on these systems, or has success
compiling it on the same or different systems with different compilers, 
*please* mail me about it.


4.0  Installation

	Unzip the "code.zip" file into a fresh directory. Unzip the
"documentation.zip" file into its own directory. Using your favorite
web browser (I recomment Internet Explorer) open the "csbase.html"
file in the documentation directory and click on the "setup" heading
in the left-most frame. This will explain how to compile with
Unix and Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0. (NB: If you don't have a frames-compliant
web browser, open the file "setup.html")


5.0  Documentation

	If you have any questions about or problems with the documentation, 
*please* tell me. There is no point in having documentation if it is unclear 
or doesn't answer your questions. Be sure to check the web page also (under "C++ Source Code"
and "Source Feedback") for more information. Don't be afraid to email me, though.


6.0  Author/Support

	Please email me any questions or comments you have about the
code (good or bad). There is a source code feedback/question and answer
page on my web page (http://www.planetquake.com/mikebot), so look there
for an answer first. However, don't be afraid to email me; I don't bite :)
