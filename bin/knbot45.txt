~:notes:~
  This is a beta of the beta of version 0.5, which is coming up. 
  I need a lot help of you guys, so don't hesitate to mail me.
  (wow I get mail for my bot!) Mail me your ideas, hints, weapons
  & stuff like that. (you will be credited)

  I was also very happy when I saw my bot on PlanetQuake in the
  quake-c archives. (www.planetquake.com\qca) Thanks for spreading
  my bot, dudes!

~:get-it-to-work:~
  Create a directory in Quake where you put this patch in
  (unzip with -d!) start quake with "-game <directory-where-patch-is-in>
  eg. "quake -game knbot"
  Start a new multiplayer game.

  -Impulse 100 to add a bot
  -Impulse 30 to toggle chase camera (very cool)
  -Impulse 31 to toggle laser targetter
  -Impulse 32 to toggle chase mode

  (most of the other impulses are messed up)

~:word from the author:~
  I thought version 0.3 would be the one and only version of the bot
  because I was working on my quake-server. (when I'm working on some-
  thing else I usually don't return to my last job) So I was on the net
  on a black day and I saw that my bot was moved to the huge file section
  no ftp.cdrom.com and to planetquake, and guess what? I had around 10
  mails in my mailbox!!! I was a happy man. Then I thought: "Okay now it's
  the time to kick some serious ass, wait till version 0.5". And here it
  is. Hope you'll like it.
  Uh yea. I got some mails from guys who can't compile my code. I was using
  another compiler . No. That's a joke .
  I forgot to add the "progs.src" and the ".h" file.
  (It should compile fine now) I also added my compiler (qcc.exe).

  I'm Ken Madlener, 14 years old, born in Holland, Europe.
  My hobbies are: *computing* (80% of free time), listening & making
  music (hardcore, yea right) My English is foolish bad .
  If you have a job or something (like program something for your TC)
  don't hesitate to mail me. I'll help you as much as I can. (for free)
  hours working on this version: +/- 30 hours (I'm getting better)
  You can always find me on a quake-server on saturday. (mostly my server
  (145.89.206.20) or quake.xs4all.nl)

~:copyright:~
  Other authors may use my code on base of other bots, but I want to
  be credited somewhere in your info file (something like I did) or
  e-mail me. (madlener@pi.net) I will be very greatfull.

  This file may be distributed as long as all the files included
  stay intact.

~:availability:~
  Yea my bot was spreaded!  thank you all!

  I will upload it tomorrow to all major sites.
  (allways look at ftp.cdrom.com/quake, the biggest site)
