I've tried my best to make sure they all work well together, and if they
don't, please let me know by writing to me at howard@mortimer.com

Hey, those aren't my code, and I can't take the credit from works of
others, so if you wanna say 'what a great patch you've made', write
to the authors of the above patches.

But if you like to say 'geez, nice work on combining those cool patches',
or, something like 'your weapons rule!', well, send them to me, then. |8^)

The first time I played Quake with the cool patches, I was impressed on
the cool stuffs that you could do with Quake C. I've tried dozens of
patches created by others, and can never get enough from them.

Then I came up with a new idea. What if I want to use a weapon from this
patch to toast a new object from that patch? So I start to dig up the
sources code of the varies patches that I've, and try to combine them
together.

There are many hot patches out there, and I just can't combine all of
them into one, so I'll have to decide on which to take, and which not to.

So far, the work is quite impressive. Now I can use the flamethrower
from the dropdead patch to BBQ Cujo, or use a radio tag pipe bomb to tag
Cujo and watch it blows up, and lots of other fun stuffs to do.

If you liked the patch, great, let me know, and tell me what other patches
you want me to put into the package.

บ  How to use Modification  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

I've included the text files from the varies patches that I've combined,
and put them into the /TXT directory, so you could look at them and see
what the commands are, as well as the authors' email addresses.
==========================================================================

 I have added many bonus weapons to this package, too, read the following
for more info.

 Press 8 (or impulse 8) a several times to scroll through the varies
lightning gun weapons, press 7 (or impulse 7) to scroll through the varies
missile weapons, press 6 (or impulse 6) to scroll through the varies
grenade weapons, press 4 (or impulse 4) to scroll through the varies
nailgun weapons, press 2 (or impulse 2) to scroll through the varies
shotgun weapons and press 1 (or impulse 1) to scroll through the varies
type of axes.

Axe weapons :
=============

 Super axe does damage according to enemy's health. The formula is :
If your health < 20, then you'll gib your enemy, as well as yourself.
If enemy health >= 30, then damage is enemy health * 80%
If enemy health < 30, > 20, then damage is 40, normal death.
If enemy health <= 20, then damage is 80, and gib the enemy.
However, you'll also take 20% of the damage you made on your enemy
as well, so be careful when you use it.

Hint : With this formular, basically you could gib anyone even with full
health with 2 swings. Play with it and see the blood and fresh fly around.

 Vampire axe does 15 damage to the enemy each swing, and give it back
to you. Extremely useful when you're low on health.

 Finally, I've spent the time to add the eagerly awaited grappling hook
a.k.a. grappling morning star to KQP. I hope it works the way it should
be, and please, "Mike" should be taken the full credit, not me. He'd
created such a cool patch that everyone wants. Press '1' a several times
to switch to it, or Impulse 32 to switch to it instantly.

Hint : Try to pull out a magnum when you've hooked someone. It's a blast.

Note : Since the original morning star will create TONS of gibs when
it's hooked to any corpse, I've made some changes so that it'll do
more damage to corpses and gib them faster. This will reduce the amount
of overhead in multiplayer games, especially over the Internet.

Note : Many people have complained about people paralyzing them with
the morning star, I've modified the morning star to unhook after 10 hits.
Also, there will be a 1 second delay between each swing, just to balance
the game play. So when someone is grappling you, try to pull out your
magnum, and as soon as the hook is released, BOOOOOM. |8^)

 A new throwing flaming axe is added. Unlike the other similar burning
axe patches, this one uses the fire 3D model as used in Blaze gun, so
when you hit someone with it, see the fire spread. In fact, even an idle
flaming axe can burn up people! Press 1 (or impulse 1) a several times to
switch to it, or simple enter "Impulse 33" for it.

Note : After your axe is thrown away and you didn't pick it up, it'll
be automatically returned to you after it's been idle for 10 seconds,
or you can pick others' axes up if you see one, as well as backpacks.

Also, When you throw away your axe, you will have NO axe left to use,
so if your axe is the last weapon you have, then after your had thrown it
away, you'll be left with NO weapon! So use with extreme care.

Lastly, when you're hooked to something (like a wall or ceiling), you can't
throw away your flaming axe, but it is STILL a flaming axe, so everything
that you chop will still caught on fire.

Shotgun weapons :
=================

 Auto-shotgun shoots out 5 shots continuously before stopping for reload.
It's reloading time, however, is slightly longer than the DB shotgun.

 I've also added a Magnum as an ass kicker. This hot metal now takes
25 ammo per shot, but even the shambler can't take 3 shots from it!!
It also has a really long range, thus is an excellent sniper weapon.

 People have told me that Magnum is really a hot metal, but it takes
30 ammo per shot, you just can't use it too often, therefore I've added
a Magnum Lite in this version. It takes 10 ammo per shot, and does less
than Magnum, but is slightly faster, and also capable to gib a person
in any range with 1 shot.


Nailgun weapons :
=================

 I've recently added a new weapon from Jonathan E. Wright (Cujo author)
called Blaze Gun to KQP. It's a really cool weapon, kinda like the
destructor weapon in Duck 3D, but much better. You can caught people on
fire with this, and it's not a sprite anymore, it's a model. Try it out.
Press 4 (or Impulse 4) several times to switch to it, or simply enter
Impulse 70 for it.

Super Nailgun weapons :
=======================

 Yet another new weapon is added - Rapid Fireball Launcher. Like Blaze
gun, its fireballs can torch up anything in sight, but it's 2 times faster
and shoot in a straight line. A new gun model is used as well. Press 5
(or impulse 5) a few times to switch to it, or simply enter Impulse 80
for it.

Note : In the current setup, pressing '5' will only center the screen,
press the keypad '+' instead to switch to super nailgun/RFL. You can change
this by binding the 5 key to something else, e.g.:
BIND '5' 'impulse xx'

 Now laser is one of the super nailgun weapons, and new laser missile and
a new laser gun model is also added. To switch to laser, press 5 (or
impulse 5) several times, or enter "impulse 81" to switch to it instantly.

 Laser can cause different level of damage to your opponents, depends on
how long it keeps burning them. Sometimes it can gib an enemy on impact,
someimes it can kill them in a second by keep burning them, sometimes it
takes more than 2 hits to kill one. Each shot now takes 2 nails, 
so keep an eye on your ammo before you run out of them.

Note : Since the laser is more accessible now, it will do less damage then
the old version, but it'll fire 2 times as fast.

Grenade weapons :
=================

 Flamethrower will sometimes burn people up. However, since this old
model of flamethrower is using sprites (pictures) rather than 3D objects,
it is slower than the new Blaze gun type flames which uses 3D objects.

 Radio Tag Pipe bombs are like the pipe bombs in Duck 3D, except if it
is not tagged to an object, it'll self-destruct in a period of time.
To detonate, enter IMPULSE 120, to disarm, enter IMPULSE 121.

 Proximity mine will stick to the walls you shoot at, and will arm itself
after approximately 2 seconds. It'll beep and explode if anyone approaches
the mine within 1-2 meter. To detonate, enter IMPULSE 122, to disarm,
enter IMPULSE 123. Excellent anti-camper weapon. Now modified so that
only 10 mines are allowed per player at a time.

 Timed Nuke takes 20 ammo for each shot, like the proximity mine, it'll
stick to the wall you shoot at. It'll arm itself as soon as it hits the
wall, and giving off the 'tick' sound. It will explode after approximate
3-5 seconds. This timed Nuke has a REALLY wide range, so make sure you're
nowhere near it when it explodes, or simply run behind a wall or so.

Hint : Make sure you can't see the timed Nuke when it explodes. If you can
see it, it can gib you, no matter how far it's away from you.

 I've added a Gib gun mode back by popular demand. Press IMPULSE 135 to
toggle between regular grenade mode and gib gun mode. When activated,
all grenades will be changed to gibs. I hope this will satisfy all you
gib lovers. |8^) By the way, it's not just a clone of the gib gun out there,
mine has more. just watch one of the gib grenade explodes...

Note : Only grenades are converted to gibs, not proximity mines, timed
Nuke, rockets, etc. 

 Also, if you fire a regular rocket in Gib gun mode, it'll work the way
just like the Gibgun patch out there, i.e. it'll enter the victim's body,
and explode after two seconds. If, however, th timing device of the gib
missile have been disturbed by the victim, (doing just anything other
than standing or running), the gib missile will explode on the next
damage the victim gets.

Note : If the victim got attacked while carrying a gib missile, he/she will
explode immediately.

 Ladies and gentlemen, here it is, a REAL flamethrower. The all new
Blazethrower will eat the old, sprite-based flamethrower's heart out.
The flames it throws follows a a ballistic path, and burn up almost
ANYTHING. What if you missed the person you tried to burn, and landed
the flame onto the floor? NO PROBLEM, it'll keep on burning ON THE FLOOR
for the next few seconds, and if some unlucky folk is stupid enough to
walk on that burning floor, he/she WILL catch on fire as well!

That's right! Just like the Blaze gun, the flame created by the Blazethrower
can actually SPREAD! So, wanna create a wall of fire? NO PROBLEM! To use it,
press 6 (or impulse 6) a several times, or enter impulse 54 to switch to it.

 Another new invention! If this freezethrower is release as a seperate
patch (which I'm going to), it'll beat all its competitions! Just read what
it can do :

When you press the fire button, the Freezethrower will not shoot out an
ice beam directly, instead, it'll start to charge up (it consumes rocket
fuel and convert it into a sub-zero beam of ice), the longer you pressed
on the button (or key), the more enery will be charged. (You can actually
see it when it charges up!)

When it's ready, release the button, and see the ice beam flies. As soon
as it hits something, it'll do a RADIUS damage (except yourself), freeze
up ALL SURROUNDING enemies. So the longer you charge the gun up, the more
damage it'll make, and the wider the radius will be.

However, like in Duck 3D, you can't freeze anything before you bring its
health down to like 20. So, keep charging your weapon, and release it
only at the best time.

Also, if you shoot the ice beam into water or slime, it'll INSTANTLY freeze
up all surrounding enemies under water, INCLUDING YOURSELF. Depends on how
much power you've charged, you could possibly freeze up everyone under water
and pick them up one by one later.

The Freezethrower will consume at most 20 rockets at a time, and it will
need at least 2 rockets to work. While you're charging the Freezethrower,
you cannot switch to another weapon, and if you're out of ammo (less than
2 rockets), it'll stop charging, but it won't fire until you release the
button.

To use it, press 6 (or impulse 6) a several times, or simply enter
impulse 55 for it. Try it, you'll love it!

Missile weapons :
=================

 Auto missile launcher shoots rockets out more rapidly, travels faster, but
is less powerful (even weaker than the guide missile, gotta be fair |8^) ).
It'll fire 3 times continuously before stopping for reload.

 Nuke is an area-effective weapon, each shots now takes 10 ammo, but is
uLTRA-POWERFUL. It does have a slow re-load time, and travels slowly, 
however, so use it with extreme care, or you'll be toasted as well.

Hint : Better make sure you're really far away from the target you're
shooting at, and see how the victims explode. This weapon works especially
well when shoots into a crowded room, ideal for ambusing people, thus this
make a good (or not that good?) camper weapon.

More Hint : Try to get a quad-damage powerup and play with it, it's virtually
a BFG.

 Flare will lits up an area for around 15 seconds, then it'll die.

 I've added a Guided Nuke weapon into this killer pack as a special bonus.
These babies costs 50 ammo, and travels like turtle, but you can guide them
to any area you want, and watch people explode from far far away.

Hint : Guided Nuke is even more powerful than regular Nuke, and have wider
range as well. So you better make sure it IS far away from you before you
hit something. BOOOOOOM!

Lightning gun weapons :
=======================

 The latest invention from the same author of Cujo and Blaze - BFG 9000.
The all time favorite DOOM weapon of many people, the Quake BFG has a
very similar effect as the DOOM version. To switch to it, press 8
(or impulse 8) a several times, or simply enter "Impulse 90". Read
the associated text file in the \killer\txt directory for more info.

Misc. weapons :
===============

 To pick up a gibbed head, simply run over it. You can only carry one
at a time. To throw it, enter IMPULSE 12. It'll then turn into a 
homing head missile and floats in the air, waiting to ambush people.

Hint : When it's floating in the air, try to shoot at it using nail 
guns or rockets, and see it bounces away.

 The floating 'homing head' missile have been modified, now the head
you throw out will be the head you've picked up, instead of the
default player's head everytime you throw (now looks cooler). Also if
it hits the ground (either you shoot at the floating head and make
it bounces to the floor (or other surfaces) or it simply lands on
the floor when it is chasing after you), it'll turn back into a
normal head, which you can't pick up again. This head will then be
removed after 10 seconds.

Hint : Use this technique well, and you can avoid many unwanted
deaths. |8^)

 The new self-destruction mode can be activated by pressing IMPULSE 230,
which is available only when your health is below 20. However, you'll get
a -5 flag if you self destruct, as a penalty, so use it only when you're
in a crowded room.

 Now backpacks are sometimes trapped. One out of five backpacks are trapped,
so during multiplayer game, sometimes you'll get bonus from people's
backpack, sometimes you'll get BOOOOOM!

Hint : There is absolutely no difference between a real and a fake backpack,
so you'll need to bet on your luck when to pick up a backpack.

 Another new deadly trap - fake backpack bombs are now available. 
Each fake backpack takes 10 rockets, it looks and feels just like the
real backpack, but only when someone pick it up, it'll go BOOOOM!
So, after you'd loot your dead opponent, leave a fake backpack there and
watch others pick it up as if someone has left it behind... BOOOOM!
To throw fake backpack, enter "Impulse 13". It is only available in
deathmatch game only.

Hint : The only different between a real (or trapped) backpack and a fake
backpack bomb is that the fake backpack bomb grows in the dark. So before
you throw a fake backpack, better make sure you're in a bright room, or
everyone will know it's a fake one.

Others features :
=================

 Some modifications have been made to the original shell eject code,
a new 'nail' bullet shell model is added, and enhanced the original
texture of the .MDL model. The ejection routine has also been modified
so that the shells are now ejected more randomly, and won't always land
on the same 5 places on the floor. The shell removal procedures is also
modified so that there will always be some shell left on the floor
while won't drag down the system too much or produces too many packet
overflows.  See below for more info.

Hint : Try to goto map e1m8 and play with it. It's like a rain of shells.

 The shells ejected are removed in a way such that there will only
be a limited number (10 for shell, 20 for bullet, and 5 for both in
multiplayer game) of them left on the floor. If more shells are ejected,
then the old ones will be replaced.

 If the game is seriously slowed down due to the massive number of
objects created by these shells ejected, you can turn it off by
IMPULSE 130. Enter it again will re-activate the shell ejection.

 Also, I've limited the maximum number of shells that can be ejected by
each person (20 for shell, 50 for bullet; 5 for both in multiplayer game)
at a time, thus will reduce the chance of packet overflow.

 I've added a portable teleporter to KQP as well. Press IMPULSE 140
to memorize current location, and IMPULSE 141 to teleport to the memorized
location. Each teleportation consumes 10 cells, and it is disabled in
deathmatch game when the player is below 50 health. (Or otherwise everyone
teleport away when they're dying.)

 I've added a really cool patch - Chasecam, please read the file included
in the \TXT directory for more info. The impulse command has been changed,
and some functions are taken away since KQP involves too many changes that
those functions will no longer work. Please read the impulse command list
below for the new impulse commands.

Note : You cannot toggle external view while you're in Cujo's view, and
vice versa. Otherwise problems will occur.

 Added banana peel. Throw it and watch your opponent slip when they walk
on it. Really funny to watch, and the sound effects are funny, too. Enter
Impulse 14 to throw one, however, you only have one at a time, and will
get it back either after someone had slipped with it, or after 30 seconds.

บ  Technical Details  บ
ศอออออออออออออออออออออผ

Bugs:

 If you're controlling your guide missile when the gibbed head is
heading towards you, it'll not explode on impact.

 During multiplayer game, when a player is burnt to death by a blaze,
not all blazes are transferred to corpse, so you may still get fire on
you after you've respawned. I'm working on a fix for this right now.

 If a dog is frozen while it's leaping, it'll continue to move
once it has landed.

 Freezing a wizard a second time (or more) will not drop it to the
floor.

 Rare bug - sometimes during multiplayer mode, the player's corpse may
disappear when he/she respawn. 

 I don't have time to test out the package throughtly after I've combined
them, so if you spot a few bugs, please let me know by email. If you
could fix them, great, just fix them, and let me know. Thanx.

 Trying to combine a few more cool patches to make the deathmatch game
looks cooler.

 Wish list (listed accoring to its priority) :
- DM bots
- more weapons to come...

 Send me any comments and patches that you want to see in KQP. I'll
try my best to add them onto the patch.

 Also notice that, since KQP is getting bigger and bigger now, the original
qcc compile will NOT be able to generate a playable progs.dat, (more info
follows), in order to compile a playable progs.dat, get the latest fastqcc
from Jonathan Roy (he'd actually compiled this special version of fastqcc
for me - and KQP!), which can be obtained at :
http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/spider/u6m1/QC/fastqcc.zip

Info : During compilation of KQP, I've found that the pr_numglobals has
exceed 16k, which is define in qcc.h as MAX_REGS, and for some time,
KQP simply screws up everything in Quake. So I contact Jonathan Roy,
and asked him to recompile his fastqcc for me with a larger MAX_REGS, and he
did, in fact, now the MAX_REGS is 64k, and I think it'll take me some time
to fill that up! |8^)

               up after 30 seconds, and if he/she doesn't respawn after
               30 seconds, his/her entity will be removed and that player
               can no longer respawn. (More serious problem is associated
               with this bug, but now it's fixed.)

* KQP has recently been rated a 10/10 by Quake Outbreak's Quake-C section
  http://www.fishnet.net/~chriscon/quakec.html

* Credits should go to all the authors of the varies patches that I've
  combined. (Well, some of them ARE my work, though. |8^) )

 ver 0.86b: This is a maintainence version from 0.86, I forgot to remove
               some of the debug info from the last version. Dooh! |8^)
             Added Laser!
             Fixed some minor problems - debug info problems such as
               stop printing out the "attacker dot destructed" message.
             Fixed self-destruction mode bug.
             Fixed some client message problem.             

 ver 0.86 : Optimized the code, now it loads and runs faster, and take
               up less memory.
             Added Super Axe.
             Added Vampire Axe.
             Added Magnum Lite.
             Added self-destruction mode. (Only allowed when health < 20)
             Modified Nuke with better explosion effect.
             Modified Magnum to take less ammo.
             Modified monsters gibs. Now with even more gibs when you
               gib corpses. Gotta like it. |8^)
             Cujo patch has been modified to Cujo 1.2c, with help from
               Jonathan E. Wright.
             Guided missile bug fixed by Jonathan E. Wright. Now Cujo won't
               attack you when you launch your guided missile. Great work,
               Jonathan!
             Fixed Cujo corpse gibbing problem. It now works the way it
               should be.
             Fixed many bugs. Some of the bugs mentioned in the above bug
               list no longer exists. If they do, however, please let me know.
             Fixed weapon change mode. Now all the weapon change impulse
               commands work.
             Fixed best weapon mode. When weapon is out of ammo, the next
               best weapon with ammo will be selected.
             Fixed multiplayer corpse gibbing problem. Now corpse gibbing
               works much better.

             Fixed several bugs.
                - Check for ammo before firing new added weapons.
                - Reduced time before gibs are removed.
             Modified Nuke to take 10 ammo for each shot.
             Removed ricochet nailgun stuffs from dropdead patch,
                as it creates too much overhead and constantly
                produces packet overflow when used with shell eject.
