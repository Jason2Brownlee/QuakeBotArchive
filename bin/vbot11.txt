Special Thanks
--------------
This bot is based almost entirely from Punisher's BGBots.  I found
his code easy to play with, so a big thankx to Punisher.  QuakeMe
was used to create the MDL file, so a big thanks out to the author.
Windows PaintBrush (ouch!) was used to create the skin for the vBot.

Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
 So.  You think you're pretty hot stuff.  You can rock _anyone_
you know in a DeathMatch.  Well.  Try this baby.  victimBOT.
Now there are innocent bystanders everywhere!  Can you avoid them
while still attacking your target??

 It began with the TM bot.  It was good, and the people rejoiced.
But it wasn't enough.  EliminatorBot was made, and it was good.
The people rejoiced.  BGBots was made, and it was good also.  The
people rejoiced.  The TangMaster began playing with the BGBots
code.  People looked in astonishment.  Suddenly.  vBot was born.
VICTIM BOTS!  These guys play in Deathmatch, run around, act like
total fools, get in your way, and if you kill them, you _lose a
frag_!  They're innocent bystanders!  Don't kill them!

 Impulse 100 creates 4 bots.

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
Make a new dir in your quake directory. (ie c:\quake\vbot)
then move this progs.dat into that directory and copy your
*.cfg from c:\quake\id1 into the same directory.
Then from the c:\quake dir. type:
        quake -game vbot

then bind a key to impulse 100

From the console type:
        bind b "impulse 100"

Technical Details
-----------------
There are, of course bugs.  I'm not exactly sure what
they are yet, but they will show up.  If you have a MAJOR
bug, please report them to me.  Thanks!

Update since 1.0
----------------
* Basically, I haven't changed anything.  This is just a housekeeping
  job.  People were complaining that the PROGS.DAT wasn't in the ZIP.
  That was true, but I just forgot -- you had to actually compile it
  before.  Now you don't.  The PROGS.DAT is in here!  Yay! ;-)
