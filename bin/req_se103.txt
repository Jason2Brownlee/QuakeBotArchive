  Welcome to Quake Requiem. This patch is designed to enhance Quake 

and it's playabilty as both a single player and multi-player game.

This patch was designed to run in Multi-Player (deathmatch) mode, 

either against other deathmatch players or against the computer

controlled roBOTs, or regular Single-Player mode against the usual

Quake monsters.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



  This patch includes new weapons, bots, Capture the Flag with Manual

Placement, powerup runes, jumping boots, jetpack, holos, radar, new

scoring systems and a few other little things you'll have to find out

for yourself... :)



  You can find this TXT file and patch at...



        ftp.cdrom.com and associated mirror sites

                        -       The first 10 stay for 45 seconds, the 

                                rest disappear after 4. Low damage.

        AIRGUN          -       Like the AirFist, shoots out compressed

        DoubleBarrel    -       Much more powerful and wider spread.

                                This is to make this weapon a little 

                                fairer and more fun to use.

        FlameThrower    -       More powerful and shoots further.

5-SUPER-NAILGUN



        Chaingun        -       Like in Doom2. No longer a nailgun, this

                                remake of the Chaingun is faster and a 

                                whole lot more fun!

        FreezeBomb      -       Freezes anything it touches. Shoots out

                                little freezers, with a glowing yellow 

                                proximity. If you get hit, or touch the

                                yellow, you'll get frozen!



6-GRENADE LAUNCHER



        GrenadeLauncher -       Same as usual.

        GibGun          -       Shoots 3 green gibbos which sap energy

                                from your enemy and then gives it to you.

                                Only a health pack will destroy the gibbbos.

        CloakingDevice  -       Turn invisible. Uses up ammo.



0-YELLOW KEY



        RandomWeapon

        Generator       -       You lose this weapon, but gain one of the

                                above weapons, calculated randomly.

        HealthRegen.    -       Regenerate your health. Uses up ammo.

                                walls and floors. You then see through the

                                eyes of the head. You can revert to your 

                                normal view by changing to any other

                                weapon. Firing again, will remove the head.



- Special Weapons!! -



        There are also two new special weapons. To get them, either get 

  both nailguns or bot grenade and rocket launcher. This will give you 

  an extra weapon available by both similar weapons.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



-Runes-



        These are courtesy of ThreeWaves great CTF patch. They are very 

similar with only minor adjustments. With RUNES, also comes some extra

advantages described below.



        Strength        -       Increases the DAMAGE you do to opponents by

                                about 1.5

        

        Resistance      -       Decreases the DAMAGE you take by about 1.5



        Speed           -       Increases your firing SPEED by about 1.5



        Regeneration    -       Regenerates your HEALTH and ARMOUR to their

                                default values.



        Each rune also has special immunities to lava, slime, freezers, 

airguns, and other assorted items, but you'll have to find these yourself :)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



-Extras-



R-      Radar           -       Bleeps and points to closest enemy. A beam

                                of electricity shoots out towards the closest

                                enemy showing their direction.



        You need a rune to use these items.



H-      Hologram        -       Creates a holo which lasts 30 seconds.



J-      Jetpack         -       Allows you to fly around. No fall damage.

        alias +hook     impulse 42

        alias -hook     impulse 43



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



-Server Settings-



        EXPERIENCE              Changes FRAGS to Experience

        FRAGS                   Regular FRAG mode



        NOEXIT          0       Exit levels as normal

                        1       Does not exit levels when touching transporters

                        2       Player blows up when touching transporters



        SAMELEVEL       0       Goes to next sequential level at end of level.

                        1       Restarts on same level at end of level.



        FRAGLIMIT       ???     Ends level when a player reaches FRAGLIMIT



        TIMELIMIT       ???     Ends level when time reaches TIMELIMIT



        SKILL           0-5     Changes bot skill level to 0 through 5. 

                                0 being easiest, and 5 being hardest.

        

        CHANGELEVEL     (MAP)   Changes the server to the specified map

                                without disconnecting users.



        SYS_TICRATE             Only used by dedicated servers.  This determines 

                                the rate at which the server will send out updates

                                to the clients.  The default value is 0.05

                                (20 updatesper second).  For servers where bandwidth 

                                is limited, using modems or the internet for example,

                                it is advisable to lower this value to 0.1

                                (10 updates per second).  This will have a very minor

                                effect on responsiveness, but will half the outbound 

                                bandwitdh required making the modem players a lot happier.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        HELP_SERVER     Shows all the help information commands ingame.



        HELP_?????      Shows information on the requested topic.

                        Use HELP_SERVER to view the topics.



        BIND_KEYS       Binds the extra impulses to the keys I have chosen.

                        Read HELP_KEYS to see the key settings. This is for

                        those who do not wish to create permanent bindings or

                        do not know how.



        KILL            Kamakazi suicide. You blow up and hopefully take 

                        someone out with you.. ;)



        PING            Show ping times on the server and clients playing.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



-Server Modes-

  As per the SERVER.CFG, most of these options speak for themselves...



        64      =       TIMED SERVER SWITCHING - When the TIMELIMIT or FRAGLIMIT

                        is reached as per the SERVER.CFG, the SWITCH.CFG is read

                        and effectively makes any changes you select. eg.

                        You can run Deathmatch1 for 30 minutes and then switch

                        to Sudden Death mode for another final 2 minutes (default)



        128     =       EXPERIENCE MODE - This changes everyones scores from 

                        FRAGS to the new scoring mode. It is based on actual

                        hits not actual kills, and also extra points for picking

                        up items and freezing, etc... A fairer, rounded option.



        512     =       LIGHTS OUT! This turns out ALL lights except for fluro 

                        lights. Everyone is then equiped with a torch to look 

                        around in the darkness. Server Admins beware.. all clients

                        that connect to this mode MUST have the patch installed.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



-Deathmatch Modes-

  Deathmatch settings are to alter the way in which you play multiplayer games.

Simply change the SERVER.CFG to added value you desire.



        1       =       Normal Deathmatch (Select this option only. Do not add)

        2       =       Items Disappear Permanently

        4       =       Weapons Stay (pick up once only)

        8       =       Random Items/Weapons Respawning

        16      =       Charging Items - You must stand on an item to charge up.

        32      =       Sudden Death! Everyone has QUAD-DAMAGE & kills are gibs.

        64      =       Mortal Countdown - Health drops to 0 then you explode.

        128     =       Enable Monsters in DeathMatch!

        256     =       Maximum Energy - Health starts at 500 and maxes at 999!



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



-Teamplay Modes-



  Teamplay is primarily the same as in ThreeWave's CTF. Typing TEAMPLAY then 

the number of which options you wish to play.

  My favourite is TEAMPLAY 1507, which is...

        1024+256+128+64+32+2+1

                

        HEALTH_PROTECT =           1;   // No health damage from friendly fire

        ARMOR_PROTECT =            2;   // No armor damage from friendly fire

        ATTACKER_DAMAGE =          4;   // Attacker takes damage from hitting teammates

        FRAG_PENALTY =             8;   // One frag penalty for killing teammate

        DEATH_PENALTY =           16;   // Die when you kill a teammate.

        LOCK_COLORS =             32;   // Allow only team colors

        STATIC_TEAMS =            64;   // Don't allow players to switch teams

        DROP_ITEMS =             128;   // Disabled

        CAPTURE_FLAG =           256;   // Play capture the flag

        TAG =                    512;   // Not operational as yet... Almost complete

                                           Due for release in REQUIEM.1.07

        MANUAL_PLACEMENT =      1024;   // Place your team flags yourself!



CTF-MP (Capture The Flag - Manual Placement) -



  The problem with the old CTF, was that you had to modify each map and

then the flags were always in the same place.

        

  With CTF-MP, you place your own flag where-ever you want it. This, I think,

adds a new element to CTF. Now you have to find the flag before you can take it.



  The first player of each team is set as Team-Leader and holds their flag.  

Hitting 'P' (impulse 15) drops the flag where you stand. After 3 seconds, any 

teammate can run over the flag and pick it up to move it elsewhere.

  While in PLACEMENT mode, being that both flags HAVE-NOT been placed, neither team

is able to shoot. Nor can you pick up the opositions flag, so no cheating. To aid

the flag-placers, the Team-Leader, carrying the flag, will be invisible, so you can 

run around and find a secret place a little easier without being followed. :)

  Once BOTH flags are dropped, and ONLY then, the game begins and the flags can no 

longer be picked up and moved. So think about where you place your flag, you may not

get another chance to move it.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



- BOTS -



  By hitting 'B' (impulse 100), you can create a roBOT, which will act as another

player, who can do everything you can do, and use the same weapons as you. You 

create up to 16 BOTs at the moment.



  You can also change the skill of each bot so that you play against a dummy, or

a whole bunch of crack-shooters. To do this, type SKILL at the prompt. This will

show the current skill level. When you hit 'B' (impulse 100), the BOT will

assume the current skill level. Skill levels range from 0 - 5. Default is 2.

  This means you can have different BOTs of different skills at the same time,

simply by changing the skill level between creating BOTs.

  Bots also use the HOOK quite alot, so you may want to get used to using it 

yourself.



  BOTs are not really supported under TEAMPLAY modes, however, I have been playing 

with the TEAMPLAY settings, and you can play a 2-team TEAMPLAY game but using

TEAMPLAY 35 at the very least. Check the options above to see what 35 does. Not sure

what would happen in other TEAMPLAY modes and more than 2 teams, as I am doing all

my testing on one PC. :(



  Typing REMOVE_BOTS will destroy all bots, incase you just cant handle dying... ;)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



- GAMEPLAY -



  There are a few things to look out for.



 When using the FreezeBomb, it would be advisible to not shoot it at close range

as you will be frozen too. The actual Bomb lasts 7-12 seconds, after which every

entity it has frozen, is thawed. The only weapon that protects against the 

FreezeBomb is the FlameThrower. If you are using the FlameThrower, you can't 

be frozen.



 When you are hit by the GibGun, your energy is sapped rather quickly. The only

way to kill the little critters that take your energy is to pick up a health

pack. This will destroy the green gibbo thingos that take your energy.



 The Radar shoots out a lightning beam towards the closest enemy in short bursts

repeating according to how close they are. This can only be seen by yourself, but

the problem is when you are using the LightningGun, you may get confused. Please

keep this in mind when using the Radar.



 Ever wanted to walk through lava? Well.. if you have the freeze gun, you can.

The newly designed freeze gun eminates a protective cold force field that 

protects you against lava... (erk fnarr fnarr) hehehe... try it out.



 If you want to know who's winning using a new scoring system, hit 'M' (impulse 44)

to bring up a scoreboard, which also includes BOTs, showing FRAGS, DEATHS, and 

who is overall at the top. 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



- SINGLE PLAYER -



 There are some new SUPER monsters based on the original monsters.



        MOBSTER         -       Like a soldier but weilds a deadly uzi...



        SUPER-OGRE      -       A red ogre that now shoots rockets!



        PSYCHO-SHAMBLER -       A purple shambler than now throws grenades!!



 These monsters appear at random throughout the game based on the skill level,

replacing the original monsters. For this reason, each time will be different! :)



 I have also redone alot of the monster-ai, and you will notice that they all 

move alot faster and even strafe now too! :) Good luck!

        This looks to be the last release of REQUIEM, as we are currently

    working on a retail conversion called TORMENTED SOULS. I will be 

    releasing more information on this shortly...



        SpecialEdtion is not really complete by my standards, but we simply

    can not continue with it due to the new project. I hope you all enjoy

    what we've done so far, and ask you to be patient for TORMENTED SOULS, 

    which will kick everything you've ever seen.    THANX

  Before I go, I'd just like to take this opportunity to thank all those awesome

Quake-C programmers who's source code and ideas I have used and learnt from. I'd 

also like to thank all the great people who helped test and refine this patch, 

especially all the Quakesters in #quake on IRC, like Ado, mrgibbed, Freek, Freaek, 

ZiNC, Indiana, VuduChild, Netspawn, Vol(mr.impulse12), AirSwing, Summoner, Manowar,

Platinum and all the fantastic people who sent me bug reports and kind emails, and 

even aaargh who said this whole patch was crap! (hehehe)



  Thanks also to all those who helped inspire this patch with works of their own

and those who actually contributed like s.boyd@dynamite.com.au for the WidowMaker

skin, and all the other authors of skins and ideas. Thanx guys. :)
