# Quake Bot Archive

The goal of this project is to archive **all versions** of **all Quake bots** (QuakeC modifications).

## Overview

Bot files (e.g. .zip and .txt) are stored in [bin/](bin/) and ongoing research notes are stored in [research/](research/).

Helpful links:

* [Quake Bot List](botlist.md): alphabetical list of all versions of all quake bots.
* [Quake Bot Genealogy](genealogy.md): estimated quake bot genealogy.
* [Quake Bot Chronology](chronology.md): estimated quake bot public release history.


## About This Project

Quake is a computer game released by id Software in 1996. The source code (QuakeC) that controls the game was released at around the same time.

A bot mod is a modification to the Quake game code to introduce "intelligent" opponents, typically for deathmatch play. Before the introduction of bots, deathmatch game play required access to a fast network or internet connection and other human players.

Quake bots represent a breakthrough in computer game artificial intelligence at the time (e.g. opponents that acted like humans), and are also a lot of fun to play (e.g. a multiplayer game can be enjoyed as a singleplayer game).

Quake bot mods were mostly developed between 1996 and 1998, were distributed as binary or source files, and were hosted on third-party websites.

There is no definitive list of Quake bots nor single location from which they can be downloaded. The third party websites that hosted the bots have disappeared over the last 25 years, along with the bot mods themselves. Some bots may be lost to time with no known backups.

This project seeks to (1) **locate**, (2) **archive**, and (3) **host** all publicly released versions of all Quake bot modifications in their original distributed form.

In addition, the project also seeks to locate and make available all versions of modifications (e.g. older versions) as well as binaries and source code for mods that may not have been made public (e.g. contributed by bot authors directly).


## How You Can Help

Perhaps you can help to make this bot archive more complete.

* Do you know of a missing Quake bot?
* Do you have a copy of a missing file from the list?
* Do you know a bot author's real name?
* Do you have have an older or newer version of a listed bot mod?
* Do you have access to the source code for an old bot?
* Do you know how to contact a bot mod author?
* Do you have access to an archive of a Quake website from back in the day?

If you can help, please email Jason at jason.brownlee05@gmail.com

### Wishlist

We also have a wishlist of known bot filenames and broken download URLs.

Perhaps you have one of the files listed?

* [Quake bot Filename Wishlist](research/wishlist.txt): list of known files missing from the archive.
* [Quake bot URL Wishlist](research/wishlist_urls.txt): list of broken URLs for files missing from the archive.
