# Quake Bot Archive

The goal of this project is to archive **all versions** of **all Quake bots** (QuakeC modifications).

## Overview

Quake bot files (e.g. .zip and .txt) are stored in [bin/](bin/) and ongoing research notes are stored in [research/](research/).

Helpful links:

* [Quake Bot List](botlist.md): alphabetical list of all versions of all quake bots.
* [Quake Bot Genealogy](genealogy.md): estimated quake bot genealogy.
* [Quake Bot Chronology](chronology.md): estimated quake bot public release history.
* [Quake Bot Filename Wishlist](research/wishlist.txt): list of known files missing from the archive.
* [Quake Bot URL Wishlist](research/wishlist_urls.txt): list of broken URLs for files missing from the archive.

## About This Project

Quake is a computer game released by id Software in mid 1996. The source code (QuakeC) that controls the game was released shortly after.

A Quake bot mod is a third-party modification to the Quake game code to introduce "intelligent" opponents, typically for deathmatch play.

Quake bots represent a historic breakthrough in computer game artificial intelligence at the time (e.g. opponents that acted like humans), and are also a lot of fun to play (e.g. a multiplayer game can be enjoyed as a singleplayer game).

Quake bot mods were mostly developed between 1996 and 2000 and were hosted on a tangle of third-party websites. Most of these websites have disappeared over the last 25 years, along with many bot mods themselves. This is a terrible loss.

This project seeks to (1) **locate**, (2) **archive**, and (3) **host** all publicly released versions of all Quake bot modifications in their original distributed form.

## How You Can Help

Perhaps you can help to make this Quake bot archive more complete.

* Do you know about a Quake bot missing from the archive?
* Do you have a copy of a Quake bot file that is missing from the archive?
* Do you know a Quake bot author's real name or how to contact them?

If you can help in any way, please email Jason: jason.brownlee05@gmail.com
