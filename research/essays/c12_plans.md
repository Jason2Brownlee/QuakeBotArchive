# .plan Files

Id software used the [finger protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_(protocol)) (e.g. the content of a `.plan` file in the user's home directory) as a blog during the development of Doom, Quake, and beyond.

Many of these messages announced releases for Quake, such as patches and updates.

Not all .plan/finger messages survive.

Surely a doom archivist captured these .plan files...
