> Hi all! Finally, I finally transferred the site to mailru.com. This is due to the fact that newmail.ru has recently become unstable, there is no ftp access, or even the site simply does not load. I tested this address and made sure that it works well! I also changed the mailbox address, now it is parboil@mailru.com. So everyone who visits us, enter the new website address http://www.parboil.mailru.com.

> Tests of the new fbca build dated January 05, 2004 have been successfully completed today. Many thanks to ParadoX for help with testing! What's new in this build: the framethink function has been changed, trigger_hurt has been activated. Many functions related to frames have also been optimized, which reduces the number of additional checks. The version can be downloaded from Files. Write your reviews, comments and suggestions to the forum!
Also, due to the ever-growing popularity of qw, a faq section has been created with basic questions about launching bots. If you think that some questions and answers are missing, suggest them and we will add them.

> Author: ParboiL (---.239.218.85.adsl-spb.net.rol.ru)
> Date:   02-17-04 10:15
>
> This test version of fbca is made specifically for qw servers on the Internet or for permanent local servers on the network. Added to this version:
> Automatically call the required number of bots.
> Automatic removal of all bots as soon as the last person leaves the server.
> Two options for assigning a skill to a bot.
> 1. The bot remembers the skill with which it was called to the server. This is convenient in FFA mode if you call bots of different skills.
> 2. Standard fbca option. The bot receives a skill installed on the server.
>
> Attention! This is a test version and for individual play I recommend using fbca version 1.01kt!

> Today, semka, former tappak, gave me a new fbca build. Here are his comments on this build:
>
> We need to test it, I added this thing. The bots are now like real ones, they run around the entire game with an ax so that they don’t knock out anything. There is such a fear that they will be slow to change weapons. It seems like I fixed the bug with backjam ping, I didn’t notice it anymore, but there is a very problematic code there. In general, you need to test: yogi: I will be wildly grateful to all testers for feedback at semka@defun.ru

> So test it, write comments and remarks to the specified e-mail or to our forum. You can download the new build here.
