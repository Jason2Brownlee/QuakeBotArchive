> Hi all! Finally, I finally transferred the site to mailru.com. This is due to the fact that newmail.ru has recently become unstable, there is no ftp access, or even the site simply does not load. I tested this address and made sure that it works well! I also changed the mailbox address, now it is parboil@mailru.com. So everyone who visits us, enter the new website address http://www.parboil.mailru.com.

> About all. ParboiL 31.10.03

> Due to the fact that the organization that provided me with the forum did not live up to the expectations placed on it, a new forum started working today! For this, my deepest bow to AvaneS! So welcome :)
Utils & Bots contains a new fbca build dated 10/27/2003. There are many fixes in this build, read more in the txt files. Based on reviews and my own feelings about the game, the version turned out to be quite successful :)
Also, in Utils & Bots, I posted a new gfx.wad. I didn’t move away from the classic Quake style, but in my opinion there are improvements. That's all for now :)

If anyone needs them, write me a letter. I understand that this is not very convenient, but I don’t see any other way out. I'm tired of this idiocy. So my apologies!

Many functions related to frames have also been optimized, which reduces the number of additional checks. The version can be downloaded from Files. Write your reviews, comments and suggestions to the forum!
Also, due to the ever-growing popularity of qw, a faq section has been created with basic questions about launching bots. If you think that some questions and answers are missing, suggest them and we will add them.

> Automatically call the required number of bots.
> Automatic removal of all bots as soon as the last person leaves the server.
> Two options for assigning a skill to a bot.
> 1. The bot remembers the skill with which it was called to the server. This is convenient in FFA mode if you call bots of different skills.
> 2. Standard fbca option. The bot receives a skill installed on the server.

> Attention! This is a test version and for individual play I recommend using fbca version 1.01kt!

> Today, semka, former tappak, gave me a new fbca build. Here are his comments on this build:
>
> We need to test it, I added this thing. The bots are now like real ones, they run around the entire game with an ax so that they don’t knock out anything. There is such a fear that they will be slow to change weapons. It seems like I fixed the bug with backjam ping, I didn’t notice it anymore, but there is a very problematic code there. In general, you need to test: yogi: I will be wildly grateful to all testers for feedback at semka@defun.ru

> So test it, write comments and remarks to the specified e-mail or to our forum. You can download the new build here.
