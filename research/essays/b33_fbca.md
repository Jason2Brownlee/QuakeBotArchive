> Hi all! Finally, I finally transferred the site to mailru.com. This is due to the fact that newmail.ru has recently become unstable, there is no ftp access, or even the site simply does not load. I tested this address and made sure that it works well! I also changed the mailbox address, now it is parboil@mailru.com. So everyone who visits us, enter the new website address http://www.parboil.mailru.com.

> Fbca 0.99kt release! ParboiL 20.08.03
>
> Finally released a new version of bots numbered 0.99kt. This version has completely changed the autoreport function. Now it is called only at the time of the message, thereby not constantly loading additional condition checks. If you or bots previously picked up the same weapon twice, only the first pick-up was reported. Now all messages are written plus messages about picking up backpacks. Here's the thing about bots. Now about myself. Since I’m currently looking for a new job, I won’t be able to go online often! I visit my email and website very rarely. I'll let you know as soon as anything changes.

lead-up news


https://web.archive.org/web/20050302144937if_/http://parboil.quakeworld.ru:80/index.html?news01.html

> New optimization fbca! ParboiL 15.09.03
>
> Over the past two weeks I have made some pretty significant changes to fbca. Optimized functions such as DesiredWeapon, lava_jump (now if the bot fails to jump, it sinks to the bottom and tries again), a_rocketjump, checkground (the bot checks the floor exactly at the shooting location), checkboven. The time for the ThinkTime function has also been increased. In this version, optimization of all code has been carried out very seriously. The version can be downloaded from Utils & Bots. It's very interesting to see the comments :)



https://web.archive.org/web/20050302144937if_/http://parboil.quakeworld.ru:80/index.html?news01.html

> The new version fbca will be soon issued! ParboiL 05.10.03
> The new version number 1.00 is currently being tested. This version completely removes the old bprint and sprint commands using WriteByte and WriteString. The functions of bot names have been completely changed, now bots have a standard netname! A lot of other things have been fixed and changed, but more on that later - wait for the news ;)


### FBCA 1.00 Release 1 (October 07 2003)

announced:

https://web.archive.org/web/20050302144937if_/http://parboil.quakeworld.ru:80/index.html?news01.html

> The new version fbca is out! ParboiL 07.10.03
>
> fbca version number 1.00 has been released. In this version, a lot of work has been done to optimize and eliminate errors. Fixed the "server crashed:" error when printing final statistics. The restriction on calling bots using maxclients now works. A lot of other things have been fixed and optimized; you can read in detail in the txt files. The version can be downloaded from Utils & bots. I'm waiting for your comments :)

https://web.archive.org/web/20050302144937if_/http://parboil.quakeworld.ru:80/index.html?news01.html

> Updates in fbca 1.00! ParboiL 10.10.03
>
> Today I posted an updated version of fbca 1.00kt. 3d[Power] suggested using his AttackRespawns feature, and after some redesign, the feature was successfully implemented. Now, starting from skill 15 and above, the bot will shoot through respawns. This is very funny, try playing with 20 on Ztndm3 and you will understand everything ;) Many thanks to 3d[Power] for your participation! 3d[Power] is involved in programming various games, visit their website www.3dpower.org!
This update also includes several changes. The function for loading aliases has been completely changed. Now aliases are also loaded for spectators, but if there is at least one human player on the server, then only two commands are available to spectators - join and observe! Download all this in Utils & bots, write comments :)



### FBCA 1.00 Release 3 (October 27 2003)

Utils & Bots contains a new fbca build dated 10/27/2003. There are many fixes in this build, read more in the txt files. Based on reviews and my own feelings about the game, the version turned out to be quite successful :)
Also, in Utils & Bots, I posted a new gfx.wad. I didn’t move away from the classic Quake style, but in my opinion there are improvements. That's all for now :)

> Due to the fact that left-handed versions of fbca appeared, I stopped posting SRC files on this site! But this does not mean that the sources will be unavailable. If anyone needs them, write me a letter. I understand that this is not very convenient, but I don’t see any other way out. I'm tired of this idiocy. So my apologies!

> ParboiL has been up to his old tricks. Updating his FrogBot Clan Arena mod yet again. Nevermind that I skipped over two of his updates :/ Also the pesky problem with the FragStats has been fixed. The database is back online with FragStats reaching back to basically the beginning of this server. Within a year or two anyways. Spoon!!
The usual policy is still in effect. Suggestions? Comments? Know the secret hideout of the local teenaged cheerleading squad? give a holler! (especially if it is in regards to the cheerleaders!!)

> New build of fbca. ParboiL 06.01.04
>
> Tests of the new fbca build dated January 05, 2004 have been successfully completed today. Many thanks to ParadoX for help with testing! What's new in this build: the framethink function has been changed, trigger_hurt has been activated. Many functions related to frames have also been optimized, which reduces the number of additional checks. The version can be downloaded from Files. Write your reviews, comments and suggestions to the forum!
Also, due to the ever-growing popularity of qw, a faq section has been created with basic questions about launching bots. If you think that some questions and answers are missing, suggest them and we will add them.

> Author: ParboiL (---.239.218.85.adsl-spb.net.rol.ru)
> Date:   02-17-04 10:15
>
> This test version of fbca is made specifically for qw servers on the Internet or for permanent local servers on the network. Added to this version:
> Automatically call the required number of bots.
> Automatic removal of all bots as soon as the last person leaves the server.
> Two options for assigning a skill to a bot.
> 1. The bot remembers the skill with which it was called to the server. This is convenient in FFA mode if you call bots of different skills.
> 2. Standard fbca option. The bot receives a skill installed on the server.
>
> Attention! This is a test version and for individual play I recommend using fbca version 1.01kt!

> Today, semka, former tappak, gave me a new fbca build. Here are his comments on this build:
>
> We need to test it, I added this thing. The bots are now like real ones, they run around the entire game with an ax so that they don’t knock out anything. There is such a fear that they will be slow to change weapons. It seems like I fixed the bug with backjam ping, I didn’t notice it anymore, but there is a very problematic code there. In general, you need to test: yogi: I will be wildly grateful to all testers for feedback at semka@defun.ru

> So test it, write comments and remarks to the specified e-mail or to our forum. You can download the new build here.
