Hi
Check out the screenshots of the Quake lighting (static lighting, not dynamic) at

http://web.inter.nl.net/users/L.J.Noordsij
(In case you dont get through, try .../L.J.Noordsij/index.html )

In the report from May 27th you will find a link to the screenshots.

The shots are taken directly from Quake and have white textures to show off the shadows.

Check it out. They are really awesome

Dennis.
