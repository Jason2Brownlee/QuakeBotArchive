# Aftershock

Aftershock was a Quake news websites by Joost Schuur.

It was an early and therefore important Quake site, although almost nothing survives. It operated prior to the release of the game until shortly after it was released: circa March to July 1996.

Note, this is different from "Aftershock Quake", the 1996 CD that contained Quake mods and tools.

Joost played an important role in the Doom and Quake community, not least maintaining the `idgames2/` archive.

> After the /doom and /doom2 archives went on hold in November 1994, Joost arranged for cdrom.com to become the new primary server a month later, and he became their new maintainer. A significant improvement was undertaken by combining and reorganizing the two archives into the canonical idgames archive, and broadening submissions to all Doom engine games. In April 1996, with Quake soon to be released, he founded and moved on to administrate the idgames2 archive.

Joost was also responsible for the QuakeTalk newsletter.

> After the first news of Quake surfaced in August 1994, until October 1995, he compiled all available information and rumors about the game into an irregular newsletter, called quakeTALK.

Many updates to the site were posted to usenet with `AftershockWave` in the title.




Sadly, no pages were archived. This was the early days of the internet archive.

A list of known in-bound links is stored here:

The site was listed in the Quake FAQ:

Aftershock is gone
Jason Springer
17 July 1996

Very sad news. Joost Schuur who ran Aftershock, has stopped running
Aftershock. Aftershock is now gone. Joost says he has reached a point
in his life where he feels computers hold him back. Very sad for Quake
fams out there. Goto http://www.nuqneH.org/aftershock/ to read more
about it. For an alternative Quake page, that I hope will come close to
filling the shoes of Aftershock, visit Quakeworld. Goto
http://www.magicnet.net/~jza/quakeworld/
Now a moment of silence for Aftershock..................................

## jschuur.com/aftershock/

After shutting down, a copy of the site was made on `jschuur.com/aftershock/` with a redirect on the old site.

Very little was archived:

* [http://www.jschuur.com/aftershock/](https://web.archive.org/web/20020201161050/http://www.jschuur.com:80/aftershock)

There is mention of this mirror here:

> Wow. You found the old Aftershock URL. Aftershock (along with Mr. Wolf's and Quake Will Rule The Cosmos) was one of the very first fan news sites on the Net dedicated to the computer Game Quake, by id Software in the early years before the game even came out and just as it was released. In many ways, it and its predecessor Doom were what got me invovled in the games industry today. I also used to do a newsletter by the name of quaketalk that was distributed via USENET at the time, way back in 1995. We didn't need no stinkin' Web back then.
>
> Eventually I moved on to other projects like Slipgate Central and later got involved with GameSpy, who I'm now full time employed with. If you're nostalgic, this is what I have left of the site. Some of the images didn't survive it and a variety of CGIs are no longer working, so it's not pretty. The nuqneH.org domain name now points at jschuur.com, my personal domain name. Proceed at your own risk.

## Slipgate Central

Months after closing Aftershock, Joost launched a Quake link website called "Slipgate Central" in December 1996.

The site started at `nuqneH.org/slipgates` and later moved to `slipgatecentral.com` in March 1997 before closing in mid 1998.

ANNOUNCEMENT: Slipgate Central launches
Joost Schuur
6 Dec 1996

S L I P G A T E C E N T R A L
The Definitive Quake Web Site Listing Launches


DECEMBER 1ST, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - After almost 2 months in the
making,
Slipgate Central, a hierarchical Quake web site listing with
descriptions
and ratings of all major Quake web sites on the Net is launched by Joost
Schuur at http://www.nuqneH.org/slipgates/.

The search for that Quake web site out there on the Net with the exact
info
that you want finally has an end. Slipgate Central opens up with a
listing
of its main 8 categories 'Sites', 'Addons', 'Deathmatch', 'Utilities',
'Information', 'International', 'Commercial' and 'Misc' which have
dozens
of sub categories making it easy to find the type of site you're looking
for
amongst over 600 links listed.

Furthermore, you can easily search for keywords appearing throughout the
site's listings with the handy search engine, keep track of new sites on
the 'Latest additions' page or just browse a random site from the entire
database. A 'Site of the Week' section offers an in depth look at a
truly
exceptional Quake web site.

Slipgate Central's pages are dynamically created from a plain text file
database, making it easy to maintain from an administrative point of
view.
The scripting language Perl is used throughout the site to automate as
many day to day tasks as possible, allowing for a single person to
easily
update this site on a daily basis.

The site is by no means complete yet. Many of the listed sites still
need to be rated and described, and many of the literally hundreds of
Quake
clans haven't been listed yet. Nevertheless, the several dozen people
that had
the opportunity to preview it prior to its launch were all amazed by its
comprehensiveness. A big hearty 'thank you' goes out to all the people
who
took the time to test it out and give feedback.

A series of yet unrevealed planned features promise to make the site
even
more powerful in the near future.

Joost Schuur is widely known in the Quake Internet community for his now
defunct Quake web site 'Aftershock', which dominated the Quake web site
scene around Quake's release, maintaining the idgames2 archive of
Walnut Creek's ftp.cdrom.com and even freelancing as id Software's
FTP/WWW
admin for a while.

He just turned 25 and currently lives in London, England, where he works
as
a software engineer for Online Magic (http://www.onlinemagic.com/), a
web
authoring company with offices in London and New York.

For more information on Slipgate Central, refer to the FAQ at
http://www.nuqneH.org/slipgates/about.html#faq or email the author
at jsc...@onlinemagic.com.
