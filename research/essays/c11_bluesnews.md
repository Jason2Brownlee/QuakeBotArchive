# Blue's News

A Quake news website by "Stephen Heaslip" aka "Blue" initially called "blue's Quake Rag" then simply "Blues News".

## panix.com/~sheaslip

The site started out as a Doom website called "blue's 3D House of 3D Carnage".

Wanna know how to "circle strafe," "strafe-run," "wall-run," perpetrate a
"silent BFG," or any of the other cool Doom tricks that you might (or might
not) be aware of?

Well I want you to know too, so I have created the net's most complete
deathmatch guide!

Check out "blue's Deathmatch Strategy Guide" available exclusively at "blue's
3D House of 3D Carnage" at this URL:

A dedicated Quake page was then created called "blue's Quake Rag", perhaps in July 1996.

It then moved to a dedicated `/quake/` sub-directory:

The content of neither page survives, although we do get redirect announcements.

I suspect the news posted to these pages become part of the news archive (see below).

An announcement was posted on `panix.com/~sheaslip/3d/quake.shtml` sharing the move to `panix.com/~sheaslip/quake/`:

```text
Don't Panic!

blue's Quake Rag has not shut down, taken a vacation, restructured, or anything of the sort...

We've just moved. Not even to a new site... Just to right here.

See you on the other side...

=D
```

The `panix.com/~sheaslip/quake/` site shared a message about the move to `bluesnews.com`:

```text
Blue's News has moved!

The sooner you change your bookmarks, the sooner you can stop seeing this screen.
This page will self destruct in 10 seconds...

Located at:

The move may have happened around October 9th 1996.

Welcome to Blue's News

We've Moved
But I guess you knew that already. Yep, bluesnews.com (I'm gonna just start calling the site Blue's News). You may recall a while back I was worrying aloud on these pages about the dangers of a personal home page growing too large and collapsing. Well, thanks to the efforts of Mike and Brian at Fluxx Designs who worked out a deal to use the hosting services of the fine folks at DigiWeb, our new home is born. The guys at Fluxx are going to help this site move forward and continue to grow and improve (Brian programmed my CGI finger scripts, for instance) and their assistance already is greatly appreciated.

Things should be familiar for now, but changes are coming. For instance, I finally have room for large files locally, so look for the files area, formerly neglected, to come to life. Also, please make use of the following new email address: blue@bluesnews.com.
