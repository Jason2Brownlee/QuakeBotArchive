# SamBot

SamBot was developed by Sam Stephens aka "Spam-man" as an extension to the roambot.

Sam describes himself as a second year computer science student at university.

	Massey Uni student, 2nd year Comp Sci, guy whose machine is too small to REALLY play quake (486dx2/66 :-(

-- SAMBOT.TXT

Only a single version of the bot was released publicly as the file sambot.zip.

It was uploaded to ftp.cdrom.com and remained a part of the archive, including modern mirrors.

The archive contains the compiled game code (PROGS.DAT), a readme (SAMBOT.TXT), source code (SAMSRC.ZIP) as well as an assortment of other files such as configuration files, files for the multiskin mod, and compilers for windows.

The key files in the release such as the compiled game code, readme and source code have a timestamp of September 8th 1996.

This matches the timestamp on the public FTP site and the date in the readme file.

	Title    : SamBot
	Filename : sambot.zip
	Version  : 0.9
	Date     : 8th September, 1996
	Author   : Sam Stephens (Spam-man on IRC, Quake, etc)

-- SAMBOT.TXT

The version is listed as 0.9, but this appears to be copied directly from the roam bot readme file.

The readme gives credit to Carson Sutton, the author of the roam bot on which the sam bot was based, as well as progenitor bots such as he BGbot, DMBot, and TMBot. Credit is also given to Dennis Noordsij, the creator of the mutliskin mod.

Key changes to the mod include the removal of shell ejection from the roam bot and the addition of multiskin support, as suggested by the credits section.

	I got rid of the ejected shells as I found more than 5 bots all fighting
	on The House of Cthon cause massive amounts of packet overflows. However
	the mod is now combined with the multiskin patch

-- SAMBOT.TXT

Sam describes hte changes as "mostly cosmetic" to the bot to make it behave less like a monster, including:

	- Bots are now player shaped, with random skins out of multiskin
	- Bots are named after their skin type
	- Bots can be gibbed (mwuhahaha :-)
	- Bots don't ever flinch in pain
	- Bots don't make idle noises, seeing noises, etc.
	- Bots respawn when killed (total kludge code :-)

	Be warned, they're now fairly bloody lethal because of the lack of flinching.
	If you want a bit of fun, try House of Cthon with 5-12 bots. But get the
	rocket launcher before you start it.

-- SAMBOT.TXT

No additional releases to the bot or other Quake mods by Sam can be located.
