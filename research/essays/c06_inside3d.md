# Inside3D

Inside3d was a website dedicated to teaching programmers how to develop quake mods using the QuakeC programming language.

It provide news on QuakeC programming and tutorials on how to implement specific features in QuakeC mods. Later it offered forums and hosted projects.

It is an important resource because many quake bot mod releases were announced on the site and many contributors to the sites in terms of news and tutorials were quake bot authors.

News posts on the site regarding quake bot announcements helped in identifying previously unknown releases of bots and providing a point of corroboration the release dates.

Later, the site also offered a series of tutorials on how to modify the reaper bot decompiled source code to add specific features.



## Version 1.0

The first version of the site was hosted as a sub-site on the QuakeC Headquarters (QCHQ) website, itself hosed on frag.com.

The URL for this early version of the site was:

* http://www.frag.com/qchq/iqc/

This early version of the site was not captured by archive.org. As such, we don't know the specific content or news that it offered.

Nevertheless, the announcement of the new site or sub-site was announced on Blues News on April 13 1997.

	April 13, 1997

	Inside Quake C
	There's a section up at the QCHQ called Inside Quake C that gives from scratch lessons in Quake C programming.

It was also announced on planetquake one day later as "great for those that want to learn Quake C.

	Quake Date: April 14, 1997

	There's a section up at the QCHQ called Inside Quake C that's great for those who want to learn Quake C.

## Version 2.0

Shortly after, the site moved from a site hosted on frag.com to a site hosted on planetquake.com.

The URL for the new site was:

* http://www.planetquake.com/iqc/

The move was announced on Redwood News on May 24 1997.

	May 24, 1997

	Quake-C Tutorial Site

	Inside .QC is a great site dealing with learning Quake-C. It includes comprehensive tutorials on several different aspects of the language.

It was announced on the PlanetQuake news page one day later.

The announcement descried it as a combining of Inside QC and Quake-C Revealed, presumably another QuakeC focused website, although the details of this second site cannot be determined.

	Quake Date: May 25, 1997

	Inside QC + Quake-C Revealed

	Budding Quake-C programmers saw today the merging of two great sites: Inside QC and Quake-C Revealed have merged here at Planet Quake. Check out Inside QC for more information.

-- http://www.planetquake.com (archived June 07 1997)
https://web.archive.org/web/19970607132605/http://www.planetquake.com:80/


The site offered:

* [News on QuakeC mods and tutorials](https://web.archive.org/web/19970607141026/http://www.planetquake.com/iqc/index2.shtm)
* [Getting started guide](https://web.archive.org/web/19970607155500/http://www.planetquake.com/iqc/started.html)
* [Downloads](https://web.archive.org/web/19970607155506/http://www.planetquake.com/iqc/download.html)

The site also offered 25+ tutorials, focused on modified weapons.




## Version 3.0

The site moved to its own domain about 4 months later.

The new URL for the site was:

* http://www.inside3d.com/

It remained at this domain for more than 15 years.

The move to the new domain may have happened in August 1997.

	On August 4, 1997 Inside.QC re-branded itself Inside3D to preempt the release of Quake II, the admins at the time forecasting the swift demise of the QuakeC language.

-- [InsideQC](https://www.insideqc.com/page/2/), FRIKAC, JULY 17 2015

The move to the new domain was announced on Blues News on October 5 1997.

	Sunday, October 5, 1997

	Inside 3D has relocated to www.inside3d.com.

-- https://www.bluesnews.com/archives/oct97-1.html

The site offered news as before, with focus on game modification more generally, not just Quake, but other games based on Quake engines with a heavy focus on Quake II programming.

* [News](https://web.archive.org/web/19980614152627/http://www.inside3d.com/)

The site also offered forums, hosted on the forums.inside3d.com subdomain, for discussing a range of game development topics.

* [Forums](https://web.archive.org/web/20000831090310/http://forums.inside3d.com/)

A news archive captured old news from May November 1997 to May 1998.

* [News Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/19980614152833/http://www.inside3d.com/oldnews.shtml)

The site hosted sub-sites focused on game development, notably, the frikbot and the quake info pool.

* [Frikbot](https://web.archive.org/web/20000817070547/http://www.inside3d.com/frikbot/)
* [Quake Info Pool](http://www.inside3d.com/qip/)

The quake area of the site continued to host a getting started guide and a dedicated QuakeC tutorial section.

* [Getting Started](https://web.archive.org/web/20000824040333/http://www.inside3d.com/qctut/started.shtml)
* [QuakeC Tutorials](https://web.archive.org/web/20000831090636/http://www.inside3d.com/qctut/)
* [Old QuakeC Tutorials](https://web.archive.org/web/19980614153538/http://www.inside3d.com/qctut/quakec.html)
* [Quake C Specification](https://web.archive.org/web/20000831090622/http://www.inside3d.com/qcspecs/qc-menu.htm)

By mid 2000, the number of QuakeC tutorials ballooned to over 170.

Importantly, this included a series of 12 tutorials on extending the reaperbot and a bot improvement protocol.

The site underwent a new look and moved hosting to telefragged.com.

The news archive was removed, and replaced with an archive linked at the bottom of each news page.

News posting ebbed and flowed over the years as different developers took over.

Perhaps by the start of 2014, updates ceased. By the end of the hear the site was hacked and was closed down.

	Due to persistent security issues, I'm putting up this rather static front page. I'll try and mirror some of the more useful content onto it as time permits. As it has been since time immemorial, the real activity of Inside3d is in the forums. If you would like your account approved, email me at gmail with your account name, from the email account you registered it with. I'll get you approved within 24 hours. -scar3crow

	You can also find us on irc, irc.anynet.org #qc

Ownership of the domain name lapsed and it was purchased by someone else who resurrected all of the old pages and redirected them to another domain with the same content, although covered in ads.



## Version 4.0

The site was resurrected in 2015 with a new domain name:

* http://www.insideqc.com

A post was shared with the re-launch of the site explaining the situation:

	JULY 17, 2015 BY FRIKAC

	I thought I’d take a moment to explain the state of things here at InsideQC.  You probably came here looking for Inside3D. InsideQC, for all intents and purposes, is Inside3D.  We have decided to change the name.  Atomic Gamer, the company responsible for hosting Inside3D, recently announced it is shutting down at the end of this month. They currently own the inside3d.com domain name.  We may gain access to that domain name after all is said and done, but for the time being we’re here at insideqc.com.

	The name InsideQC goes back to the very founding of the site. Back in the old days, Inside.QC was created on Frag.com as a tutorial site and after a short time, it was consumed by the “borg of the Quake community, PlanetQuake” and moved to planetquake.com/iqc.  On August 4, 1997 Inside.QC re-branded itself Inside3D to preempt the release of Quake II, the admins at the time forecasting the swift demise of the QuakeC language. Later, Inside3D moved to Telefragged and obtained the shiny new inside3d.com domain name. Telefragged then eventually morphed into Atomic Gamer.

	Inside3D lived happily on Atomic Gamer for many years and we owe the team of people behind that site a great deal. Eventually, however, Inside3D fell into disrepair. The main site was defaced. The forums were spammed and locked down. Key people from the site had moved on with their lives and the site started to wither.

	I say we try to reverse that! So with that, here is the brand new version of Inside QC. For now the only thing of note is the forums. If you want to talk to the admins of this site, hop on over to #qc on irc.anynet.org. If you need approval for a new account on the forums, email scar3crow or try to find me on irc. Scar3crow’s email address is what you’d expect at gmail.com.

About 148 QuakeC tutorials can be accessed for posterity:

* [QuakeC Tutorials](https://www.insideqc.com/qctut/)

An archive of the Frikbot site is also preserved:

* [Frikbot](https://www.insideqc.com/frikbot/)

Initially, it provided access to the lost tutorials, although eventually began to collect the occasional news post.

More recently, the forums were also resurrected:

* <https://forums.insideqc.com/>

The site remains in this preserved state at the time of writing.
