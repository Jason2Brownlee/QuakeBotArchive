# QuakeC Mailing List by Robert Dean Rudeseal

Many email lists were created to discuss quake and quake editing.

An early QuakeC Mailing List was created and managed by Robert Dean Rudeseal and his company Seal Industries.

This mailing list is important because authors of some of the first bots, the DMBot and MyBot were members, interacted and announced some releases of some bots.

Robert was active on Usenet, engaging in discussion about Quake and announcements from id software in early and mid 1996.

In July 1996 he started a mailing list dedicated to discussing the QuakeC source code and development of modifications.

The QuakeC source code for Quake v1.01 and the QCC compiler were released on the 25th of July 1996, e.g. the file qcc.tar.gz.

Robert appears to have started his Quakec mailing list a day before on the 24th of July 1996, likely anticipating the release. He shared the announcement of the mailing list across many quake-based Usenet groups on this day with the title "quake-c mailing list is now UP!!".

	You are invited to join the quake-c mailing list.

	...

	Quake-C is dedicated to advancing the discussion and devlopment of
	the PRIMARY Programming language used in the Game of QUAKE.
	As you know Quake-C is the backbone of the entire game platform.
	It controls just about every action in the game, Including Server
	Interactions.

	This list is intended to cover the following subjects:

	ON TOPIC ISSUES:

	1) 3d map editor implementation of entities (monstors, doors, players,
	etc...).
	2) Pure Quake-C programming, Tutorials, Examples, algorithams, and development
	of same.
	3) Networking and server programming issues.
	4) .MDL Development. (all subjects-animation, behavior discussions)

Months earlier in March 1996, Robert was asking around if any such Quake editing mailing list existed.

It seems that later, perhaps for lack of finding such a mailing list, he decided to bring one into existence himself.

	Has anybody set this up yet. Subscribed to something on the Doom-Editing
	Mailing list. But it seems that this was a bogus post on the list as 1) it has
	not happened yet. and 2) whoever was setting it up, if I remember correctly,
	wanted the list to be extremely limited and had nothing to do about editing
	Quake (even though it was called the Quake-Editing List). Any takers????

-- Quake-Editing Mailing List, Robert Dean Rudeseal, 19 Mar 1996.

At some point, Robert created a webpage for the mailing list that contained instructions and an archive of the email on the list.

	There is a related WWW page at:

	http://www2.csn.net/~rudeseal

	It contains both the Mailing List Archives and the Quake
	Specifications Draft.

The QuakeC mailing list archive was captured by archive.org in 1999, and some of the .zip archives of the email messages can be retrieved.

Although the mailing list appeared to have started on July 24th 1996 and was running at least to December 12th 1996, the archive starts on "July 24 to July 29 1996" and runs to "August 29 to August 31 1996".

It appears the email address is different between the first announcement (majordomo@csn.org) of the list and the later announcements (quake-c@seal-industries.com), suggesting the server was moved shortly after the list was setup and some messages were lost or discarded in the move. The termination of the archive at the end of August may suggest the burden of maintaining the archive proved too much.

Only 6 of the 10 archives files of the mailing list were captured by archive.org.

The mailing list archive covers the following dates:

* July 24 to July 29 1996
* July 30 to August 1 1996
* [August 1 to August 4 1996](https://web.archive.org/web/19990501112147/http://www2.csn.net/~rudeseal/quakec/quakeclist801-804.zip) (archived)
* August 5 to August 7 1996
* [August 8 to August 12 1996](https://web.archive.org/web/19990501115538/http://www2.csn.net/~rudeseal/quakec/quakeclist808-812.zip) (archived)
* [August 13 to August 15 1996](https://web.archive.org/web/19990501122114/http://www2.csn.net/~rudeseal/quakec/quakeclist813-815.zip) (archived)
* [August 16 to August 18 1996](https://web.archive.org/web/19990501123227/http://www2.csn.net/~rudeseal/quakec/quakeclist816-818.zip) (archived)
* August 19 to August 21 1996
* August 22 to August 25 1996
* [August 26 to August 28 1996](https://web.archive.org/web/19990501132728/http://www2.csn.net/~rudeseal/quakec/quakeclist826-828.zip) (archived)
* [August 29 to August 31 1996](https://web.archive.org/web/19991113203504/http://www2.csn.net/~rudeseal/quakec/quakeclist829-831.zip) (archived)

Importantly one, "August 26 to August 28 1996" discusses early quake bots.

This archive contains email discussion of the DMBot by the author Nathaniel Gorham.

It also covers the sees communication with Nathaniel by Stephen Vanterpool, the author of the MyBot that extends it, and the announcement of MyBot v1.1.

I suspect if a fuller version of the archive can be located, then further interesting discussions may be located.

Surprisingly, this mailing list is still reported as a resource more than a year later.

Raphael Quinet posted a large message on the rec.games.computer.quake.misc Usenet group that listed resources for getting help with quake, including Robert's QuakeC mailing list, among other mailing lists.

	Quake-C programming, tutorials, examples, algorithms, and
	development of same. This list is moderated, and is not for general
	discussion topics. For more info and posting guidelines, send a
	message containing "info quake-c" to majo...@seal-industries.com.

It is not clear if this is in error or the mailing list was still alive and active.

If still active after a year, who knows what great discussions have been lost.
