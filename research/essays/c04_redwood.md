# Redwood's 3D News

Redwood's 3D News or simply "Redwood News" is a game news website started and run by Sean Martin aka "Redwood".



## tamu.edu

The first version of the site was provided as a student website at "Texas A&M University" (TAMU).

It was focused on Quake and was available via the URL URL:

* http://http.tamu.edu:8000/~stm9233/quake.html

Alternative subdomains may have been used once the site gained some popularity, such as:

* http://aggiequake.tamu.edu/

This site was generally regarded, even before Quake modding took off, as seen in this Usenet post from August 1996 discussing the "best quake news sites".

	I agree with you that Blue's Quake Rag is one of the best Quake news page.
	Unfortunately I have only recently discovered it, but before Blue's I used
	to read Redwood's Quake Page, which is also frequently updated (until
	recently, because he has to go to school :-( . I think Blue's and
	Redwood's are equally good and the best news pages out there for Quake. I
	agree that Stomped is a decent site, it's just that they don't have a lot
	of updated news.

The site also appeared in the short list of recommended Quake news websites in the Unofficial Quake FAQ version 2.0, created and managed by by Toby Goldstone.

Sadly, this version of the site was not captured by archive.org and may be lost.


A final goodby message was posted after the site moved to the new domain.

## redwood.gatsbyhouse.com

The second version of the site was hosted as a subdomain on gatsbyhouse.com.

The site was available from the URL:

* http://redwood.gatsbyhouse.com/news.html

Importantly, much of this site was captured by archive.org in the late 1990s.

A helpful page that was captured is the Quake News Archives, archived on March 27 1997.

This includes links to archived webpages of Quake and gaming news, with one page per month from April 1996 to March 1997. All of these pages were archived, providing a time capsule of Quake news from the time.

Highlights include the release of the reaper bot in October and November 1996, including locally hosted copies of the released (not captured by archive.org)

During this time Sean Martin actively developed the WinQuake FAQ and hosted in his website.

Sean then shared links to the FAQ on Usenet.

	I have posted the preliminary version of my WinQuake FAQ on my web
	page at
	http://redwood.gatsbyhouse.com

	or directly at http://redwood.gatsbyhouse.com/quake/wqfaq.html

## redwood.stomped.com

The final version of the site was hosted as a subdomain on stomped.com, itself a popular gaming website that started off sharing Quake news.

The site was available from the URL:

* http://redwood.stomped.com

The moved to stomped.com happened in early April 1997.

	April 1, 1997

	...
	Yes, I'm moving to Stomped. The page isn't really ready yet. I only have a few files up. I haven't changed them yet either, so basically ignore it.

Later in the month, Sean commented that he was taking over all Quake news on stomped.com.

	April 23, 1997

	As you may have noticed, somebody else did an update yesterday. That is because, with my move to Stomped and shortly, the take over of all of Stomped's Quake News, I have gained the help of 3 news assistants ...

Steven Heaslip aka "Blue", another top quake and game news site, listed Redwood's News site as one of the must-read news sites, along with sCary's Sugar Shack.

	Redwood's 3D News is one of the oldest Quake news pages in existence.  Age is naturally relevant, but a site that is over a year old is quite old in the world of Quake.  This news page, which has now expanded to cover the entire range of gaming news, is now part of Stomped.com.  This arraignment has given Redwood some assistance with the news.  Updates from other members of Stomped are typically identified by name.  One of Redwood's greatest advantages is Sean "Redwood" Martin's relationship with the gaming community in the Dallas area.   Martin was a beta tested for both and Quake 2, and was thus able to provide a great deal of information on these games.  Redwood's covers gaming news but also addresses internet related new, such as the release of new browser and information about new gaming hardware. It is also the home of the WinQuake FAQ and an impressive collection of Quake files.

Much of this site was captured by archive.org.

A key webpage includes the news archive that has links to one page per month of news from 1996 to 1999.

* [http://redwood.stomped.com/archives.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20011216182813/http://redwood.stomped.com/archives.html) (archived December 16 2001)

At some point in 1999, probably July, the Redwood's News site shutdown an became the homepage for stomped.com.

The old subdomain was shutdown and left with a placeholder message and a redirect to the stomped.com homepage.

	Redwood's 3D News has moved.

	Redwood has moved into Stomped. Read more about it there. You should be taken there automatically. If not, click on the golden foot.
