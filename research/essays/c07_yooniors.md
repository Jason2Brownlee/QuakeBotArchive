# YoonioR's Quakepage / Krakow's QuakeToys

YoonioR's Quakepage (polish) provides a good source of old quake news and files.

I believe the site was run by "Piotr Marek Jr.".


> Hello, YoonioR's Quakepage (the oldest Quake page in Poland) is celebrating its first anniversary (it first saw the light of day on October 14, 1996 ).

QUAKE: Polish Websites
Piotr Marek Jr.
27 Oct 1996

Hello,
I am pleased to inform you that Polish websites dedicated to the game
QUAKE (by id Software, the people who wrote the immortal DooM) have been created.

Until now, there were no real websites in Poland, but now there are -
in Polish, in ISO 8859-2 format. Here:

- = YoonioR's Quakepage = -
http://www.pk.edu.pl/~pmj/quake/
----------------------------------

At this address you will find the following sections (with an exhaustive
description of each of them):
- NEWS (what's new in the Polish Quake world)
- MIRRORS (description of Polish mirrors related to Quake)
- QUAKETOYS (what are QuakeToys and what can be found there)
- SERVERS (list of Polish servers + precise _current_ information
about who and where is currently playing, and even what color their pants are ;->)
- PLAYERS (list of Polish DM players)
- LINKS (the most important places in the world related to Quake)
- FAQ (current version of Unofficial Quake FAQ)
- SCREENSHOTS (game photos taken by Polish players)

"YoonioR's Quakepage" is modeled (I don't hide it :-) on
the best Quake WWW server, "The Quake Stomping Grounds".

The pages are written in Polish and intended for Polish Quake players
(and those who haven't heard of Quake but would like to). I hope
they will become a place where players will come for advice and
news.

I cordially invite you
YoonioR

Koniec QuakeToys. 1996-1998. RIP
Piotr Marek Jr.
9 June 1998

Hello,
I am pleased to inform you that the oldest in Poland and one of the oldest in the world Quake archives, Krakow's
QuakeToys (a YQP support) has been closed and
the content completely deleted, including the idstuff mirror
(one of 20 mirrors distributing the first release of Quake shareware in June 1996).

I had no influence on this decision, it was beyond my control.

The only copy now exists on my private CD...
They take up almost 300MB.

Thus, QuakeToys and Krakow's Quake resources on ftp
are becoming history after TWO years. RIP.

Thank you to everyone who sent files, together we created
unique Q archives in Poland. I sincerely
thank Cinek (former formal ftp admin)
for providing access to the university server resources.

I ask all interested parties to delete links
referring to ftp.pk.edu.pl/games/id/

YoonioR

p.s. please do not express condolences.
```
