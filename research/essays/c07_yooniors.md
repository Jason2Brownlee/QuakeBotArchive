# YoonioR's Quakepage / Krakow's QuakeToys

YoonioR's Quakepage (polish) provides a good source of old quake news and files.

I believe the site was run by "Piotr Marek Jr.".


> Hello, YoonioR's Quakepage (the oldest Quake page in Poland) is celebrating its first anniversary (it first saw the light of day on October 14, 1996 ).

## Shutdown

```text
Koniec QuakeToys. 1996-1998. RIP
Piotr Marek Jr.
9 June 1998

Hello,
I am pleased to inform you that the oldest in Poland and one of the oldest in the world Quake archives, Krakow's
QuakeToys (a YQP support) has been closed and
the content completely deleted, including the idstuff mirror
(one of 20 mirrors distributing the first release of Quake shareware in June 1996).

I had no influence on this decision, it was beyond my control.

The only copy now exists on my private CD...
They take up almost 300MB.

Thus, QuakeToys and Krakow's Quake resources on ftp
are becoming history after TWO years. RIP.

Thank you to everyone who sent files, together we created
unique Q archives in Poland. I sincerely
thank Cinek (former formal ftp admin)
for providing access to the university server resources.

I ask all interested parties to delete links
referring to ftp.pk.edu.pl/games/id/

YoonioR

p.s. please do not express condolences.
```
