## history

I suspect the pre-history telefragged site was hosted on Datawave [dwave.net](https://web.archive.org/web/19961221110836/http://dwave.net/) (archived) by Brian (quakegod@dwave.net or bam@dwave.net).

The original site might have been called "The Quake Zone" and hosted at `biz2.dwave.net/~quake` or `dwave.net/~quake`

Later telefragged.com was hosted on DataWave, see the [Datawave Games](https://web.archive.org/web/19970514224518/http://www.dwave.net:80/games/) page.

Telefragged was co-founded by QuakeGod and Raven according to the [staff page](https://web.archive.org/web/19990224160550/http://home.telefragged.com/staff/).
