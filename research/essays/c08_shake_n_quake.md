# Shake N' Quake

A Quake news and resource webpage operated by Tom Grandgent aka "Woofer", Chris Elly aka "Overlord", and Felipe Garcia "O-dog".

The site appeared to operate from July 1996 to January 1997.

It is an important website as it lists news and links to early bot release, such as the reaper bot and client-side bots.

## Shutdown

A shutdown message was posted, dated January 8th 1996, although I suspect it was a typo and was in fact 1997.

> Good-Bye: Hello people this is me O-dog. We have spent the last few months together on a journey through Quake news. For me it has been a fun time and has provided me with an in depth look at the inner workings of the Quake community. From the release of Quake people have come together because of their shared love for a computer program. This phenomena is pretty amazing when you think about it. People who normally might not ever talk to or meeting getting a chance to share in something special. Well I have been happy in giving you, the Quake community, the daily updates of news Quake. But like all good things it has come to an end here at Shake n' Quake, at least for me. Life is a difficult and busy thing and the daily chore of coming to the computer and updating the page with news is a hard thing to do. Other things come up, or sometimes you just are in a bad mood and don't feel like it. For a while there during Christmas break I was able to keep up the level of updates I shoot for and did, in my opinion, a very good job. The advent of school once again though has keep me away from this and the level of quality and quantity of updates as you can see has dropped. My thoughts behind my leave is that if I am not going to be able to keep up with the best news pages up there like Blue's News and Scary's Quakeholio then why should I bother. Those sites by far are some of best news sites not just about Quake or any computer product out there. Their level of excellence is something that anyone designing a news page should shoot for. That was my goal in the beginning to try to get news those sites didn't have and to provide a secondary source of Quake news. So I hope can see where I am coming from with my resignation from the site. I would like to thank Tom Grandgent for letting me update his page for him, and all of the people who took time out of there lives to E-mail me or use the feedback form to give me info or comments. Those people are the true reason that pages like this is possible. I am sorry to say too that the future of this page is very grim as well. A 95% chance of the news portion of the page being shutdown is likely. The rest of the page will be up though. Well I guess that covers all of the stuff on my mind right now. Have a nice day and if you have anything on your mind concerning Quake or this page you can E-mail me.
