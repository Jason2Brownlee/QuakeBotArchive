# sCary's Sugar Shack aka Shacknews

Another important Quake and gaming news site from the late 1990s was sCary's.

The site was started by Steve Gibson and Maarten Goldstein.

Originally it was called "Scary's Quakeholio", later "sCary's ShugaShack" or just "ShugaShack", and eventually "ShackNews, it's modern incarnation.

	Throughout the day, we've been celebrating the 25th anniversary of the day Shacknews was brought into the world. This website started life as Quakeholio, then spent years as Shugashack, and finally morphed into the Shacknews of today.

## Version 1.0

Steve Gibson started a quake news site called "Scary's Quakeholio" on quakehole.com.

	Shacknews was founded in 1996 by Steve "Scary" Gibson, 20 years old at the time, as a website dedicated to following news about the then-upcoming game Quake from id Software. The original name of the website was "Quakeholio".

-- [Shacknews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shacknews), Wikipedia.


The site was available via:

* http://quakehole.com

The site was probably started in late 1996.

Some of the earliest news posts on the site that survive are dated from October 25 1996, announcing the released of the reaper bot version 8.0.

Not a lot survives from this early version of the site.

The archive.org capture of the site is spotty and mostly contains later versions with unrelated content by subsequent owners of the domain.

Some key pages that do survive from this time include:

* [Files Section](https://web.archive.org/web/19971210063938/http://www.quakehole.com/standard/files.html)
* [QuakeC Patches](https://web.archive.org/web/19971210064001/http://www.quakehole.com/standard/quakec.html)
* [Maps](https://web.archive.org/web/19971210064619/http://www.quakehole.com/standard/maps.html)
* [Links](https://web.archive.org/web/19971210064715/http://www.quakehole.com/standard/links.html)
* [Demos](http://www.quakehole.com/standard/demos.html)

And others.

The links page is really quite impressive.

Only portions of the news on the site survives.

For example:

* [Home](https://web.archive.org/web/19971210063911/http://www.quakehole.com/frames/home.html)
* [Old News](https://web.archive.org/web/19971210064427/http://www.quakehole.com/frames/oldnews.html)


The exact date that the site was shutdown is not known. It was likely September 1997, based on some of the last dates of news articles.

A final message posted in October 3rd 1997 comments on the migration of the site from quakehole.com to hipnotic.com.

	I'm workin on it.. 5:15pm - 03/10/97

	I've gotten about 3/4ths of a bare bones news page ready at www.hipnotic.com for you guys.. hope to see it on line within 24 hours. We are also hoping to have a bit of tutorial ready to help everyone put rotation in to their maps.

A capture by archive.org on December 1997 of (one of) the homepage shows a redirect message to a news site on hipnotic.com.

	sCary's Quakeholio is now sCary's Sugar Shack hosted on www.hipnotic.com/news.htm

	As for the future of www.quakehole.com,that is undecided. please visit www.gamesmania.com though in the mean time.

	All the files / demos / stories / morons.txt stuff will be available on the new page within the week.

## Version 2.0

The site moved to Hipnotic Interactive and was focused on quake news.

* http://hipnotic.com/news.htm

They were responsible for the development of the first official mission pack for quake titled "Quake Mission Pack No. 1: Scourge of Armagon".

Portions of the news written by Steven Gibson from this time survive in archive.org.

For example, posts in late December 1997 survive, including a news post about the first version of the Omicron bot v1.00.

* [News](https://web.archive.org/web/19971212025339/http://hipnotic.com/news.htm)

Sadly, the archive of news on the site at http://www.hipnotic.com/archives/archives.htm does not appear to have been captured by archive.org.

Some pages that do survive and were captured in December 1997, include

* [Files](https://web.archive.org/web/19971212030303fw/http://www.hipnotic.com/shack_stuff/files.htm)
* [Links](https://web.archive.org/web/19971212030204fw/http://www.hipnotic.com/links.htm)

The company later changed their name and became Ritual Entertainment, perhaps in late 1997.

	Based in Dallas, Texas, Ritual Entertainment was formerly known as Hipnotic Interactive, during which period they began development of their signature video game SiN.

	...

	In late 1997, Hipnotic changed their name to Ritual Entertainment in order to avoid a trademark conflict with another video-game developer, Hypnotix.

-- [Ritual Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual_Entertainment), Wikipedia.

The site later changed to:

* http://ritualistic.com

A capture by archive.org on January 21 1998 suggests that Steve did not come to the new site and instead parted ways.

	This page will auto forward you to www.ritualistic.com

	sCary's News page has moved to:

	http://scary.vrgames.net

-- [http://hipnotic.com/news.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/19980121020639/http://hipnotic.com/news.htm) (archived January 21 1998)

The new news site on ritualistic.com does not appear to feature Steve although links to his new site.

	While checking out a Trespasser preview I saw linked at sCary's, I saw that they had an extra page talking about the other 3D games coming out this year, like of course, SiN.

## Version 3.0+

The site moved "Virtual Reality Games Network", perhaps in early 1998.

The site was accessible via:

* http://scary.vrgames.net/

Blues news mentions this page in January 1998 in his guide to Quake news webpages.

	sCary's Sugar Shack is another veteran in the gaming news business.  sCary's original news site, the Quakehole, was shut down after he accepted a job with Ritual Entertainment. The Quakehole has been reborn into the Shuga Shack.  Now, sCary has moved the shack to the Virtual Reality Games Network.   sCary presents the news with his own, unique brand of humor.  In addition to the all of the features expected from a news site, the Shuga Shack also houses a large collection of Quake and Quake 2 demos.

Little of this version of the site survives, I suspect because it did not last long here before moving to a dedicated domain.

Those files that do survive were captured 10 years later and were likely left on the server accidentally.

For example:

* [Quakeworld](https://web.archive.org/web/20000818132508/http://scary.vrgames.net/quakeworld/)

By this time, quake mod development and Quake bot development was thin. Most effort was focused on Quake II and other games. Our interest in the site wanes at this point.

It later became shugashack.com, probably in early to mid 1998 and focused more broadly on 3d gaming news, not just Quake.

* http://www.shugashack.com

Eventually, the site became "Shack News" at shacknews.com and the seeds of the massive gaming news site.

* http://www.shacknews.com/




## Rocket Jump

Importantly, shacknews was responsible for contracting David Craddock to write "Rocket Jump", a biography of Quake and related games in 2017.

It was shared for free in the site, where it remains accessible today.

* [Rocket Jump: Quake and the Golden Age of First-Person Shooters](https://www.shacknews.com/article/101156/rocket-jump-quake-and-the-golden-age-of-first-person-shooters)

It later became a book, publushed with the same name in 2019.

* [Rocket Jump: Quake and the Golden Age of First-Person Shooters](https://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Jump-First-Person-Shooters-Shacknews-ebook/dp/B07VFBJ8GX/), David Craddock, 2019.

I highly recommend reading the online or book version.
