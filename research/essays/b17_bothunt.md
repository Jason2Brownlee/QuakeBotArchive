The release credits the BGBot, on which this bot was based, as well as progenitor bots including the DMBot and TMbot. The readme also credits the Multiskin release which was incorporated into the bot to support multiple different skins for the bot.

The bot supports both cooperative and deathmatch play.

	Impulse 100 creates 1 bot, but up to 13 with different names.
	This(these) bot(s) will help you in co-op and kill you in deathmatch. My
	computer sucks and can only handle up to 9. These bots will be
	like a real player.  Can pick up everything, but the invisibility
	does not work right and the biosuit doesn't matter.  They gib if they
	happen to fire lightning underwater.  They can use all weapons and
	will resort to the axe when out of ammo.

Douglas also released a weapon mod called "Pistol" that had at least 3 versions.

In the final version of the mod, he also mentioned his "Bot Hunt" mod.
