# Quake on Usenet

Quake Usenet groups were important for three main reasons.

The firs is that some bot authors announced their bots on there, providing timestamps, links, and even the content of the readme files distributed with the bots. This provides an invaluable source of the history of some bots and readme files that could not be acquired any other way.

The second reason is because quake players discussed the bots and pointed out download location for bots. This provides a rich source of sites to explore in the internet archive.

Finally, some BBS share lists of files on Usenet periodically. This was a common practice in the late 1990s. As such many intermediate bot releases can be discovered from these file lists, sometimes with useful comments and timestamps.




## What is Usenet

Usenet was a network of newsgroups on the internet.

Usenets were typically interacted with via a news reader, a special piece of software that allowed groups to be browsed, searched, subscribed to, and for messages to be read and written.

The groups themselves were hosted on servers and mirrored to servers all around the world. A typically user might connect to the local internet service provider news server in order to read and interact wit the group, the changes of which would be propagated to the main host of he group.

	Usenet is distributed among a large, constantly changing set of news servers that store and forward messages to one another via "news feeds". Individual users may read messages from and post to a local (or simply preferred) news server, which can be operated by anyone, and those posts will automatically be forwarded to any other news servers peered with the local one, while the local server will receive any news its peers have that it currently lacks. This results in the automatic proliferation of content posted by any user on any server to any other user subscribed to the same newsgroups on other servers.

Archives of the news groups were also maintained on websites and FTP servers.




## Quake Usenet Groups

The main Quake Usenet groups were rec.games.computer.quake.

For example:

* rec.games.computer.quake.announce
* rec.games.computer.quake.editing
* rec.games.computer.quake.misc
* rec.games.computer.quake.playing
* rec.games.computer.quake.quake-c
* rec.games.computer.quake.servers

Previously, the groups were in alt.games.quake.

	Six newsgroups are available for discussing the game Quake, by id Software, and the various add-ons related to Quake. Some news servers also carry a seventh group, alt.binaries.games.quake, in which binary files can be posted. This article will give you some advice about where and how to post your articles, in order to make these groups more useful and more enjoyable for you and the other readers.

The move to rec.games.computer.quake.* was made in 1995, according to a Usenet FAQ

	In 1995, the readers of a.g.q chose to move to the rec.* hierarchy in order to reach a wider audience and make sure that nobody is deprived from the information about Quake.

-- [FAQ: replacement of a.g.q by rec.games.computer.quake.](https://groups.google.com/g/rec.games.computer.quake.misc/c/aGWFslEL-K0/m/trYffXpKQX8J), 6 Jan 1998.

The last group to be created on was on QuakeC development.

Before the quake-c group was created, QuakeC discussion happens in the rec.games.computer.quake.editing group.

	Discussion of QuakeC, the Quake programming language, should also be posted here until a separate r.g.c.q.quake-c group is created.

-- [2nd DRAFT: () Welcome to the Quake newsgroups! ()](https://groups.google.com/g/rec.games.computer.quake.misc/c/exKVkoYg28M/m/u8-araRAwEQJ), rec.games.computer.quake.misc, Raphael Quinet, 12 Aug 1996

The rec.games.computer.quake.quake-c group was proposed in early August 1996 by Raphael Quinet in response to the QuakeC discussion occurring in the editing group and to Robert Dean Rudeseal's QuakeC Mailing List being overloaded.

	After a short discussion on the quake-proposal mailing list, it was decided
	that a newsgroup dedicated to Quake-C would be very useful. It will provide
	a place where programmers can exchange technical infos about Quake-C, some
	tips and tricks, and short exceprts of source code. Quake-C is currently
	discussed in r.g.c.q.editing and on the quake-c mailing list, which is a bit
	overloaded (up to 100 messages per day, more than 400 subscribers). The new
	newsgroup will be a more efficient way to share the informations about
	Quake-C and will be very useful for those who had to unsubscribe from the
	mailing list because of the high traffic.

-- New Quake-C newsgroup (rec.games.computer.quake.quake-c), Raphael Quinet,

The official request for discussion (RFD) to propose the rec.games.computer.quake.quake-c group was shared by Raphael Quinet on the 14th August 1996.


	CHARTER: rec.games.computer.quake.quake-c

	This group is for discussing Quake-C, the language which defines
	Quake's behaviour. All technical topics related to Quake-C are
	allowed, such as programming tricks and special effects, how to enable
	some features, etc. Level editing topics do not belong here and
	should be posted in .editing.

	Excerpts of source code may be posted here, as long as they are
	reasonably short (not more than a few dozen lines). Longer scripts or
	compiled code should only be announced here and posted in a binaries
	group (alt.binaries.games.quake) or uploaded on a FTP or WWW server.

	END CHARTER.

-- [RFD: rec.games.computer.quake.quake-c](https://groups.google.com/g/news.announce.newgroups/c/kk5ns1MsVxs/m/P1DG-vVjXmcJ)

There was a call for votes on the group in September and the rec.games.computer.quake.quake-c group was added on October 1996.

	Three groups (.announce, .editing, .misc) were created at first, in January 1996. When the traffic increased, two additional groups (.playing, .servers) were added in May. The latest addition is the .quake-c group, which was created in October.

## Usenet Archives

Google offers access to a massive Usenet archive via groups.google.com.

This archive is based on Google's purchase of the "Deja's Usenet archive", a comprehensive archive of Usenet.

	The Deja News Research Service was an archive of messages posted to Usenet discussion groups, started in March 1995 by Steve Madere in Austin, Texas. Its powerful search engine capabilities won the service acclaim, generated controversy, and significantly changed the perceived nature of online discussion. This archive was acquired by Google in 2001.

-- [Google Groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Groups), Wikipedia.

Specific news groups can be browsed, but more usefully, specific groups can be searched and searches can be performed across all groups.

This is an effective way to search for the existence of intermediate bot releases as well as candidate URLs for bot downloads that may have been archived. In some cases, binary files are included in the Usenet archive and can be downloaded directly.

The search feature is effective, but not perfect. It is a good practice to keep queries short, even just a single keyword such as a person's name or handle, a bot name, or filename. Complex queries often fail to return results, even when results with a given phrase are known to exist.

There are other smaller Usenet archives on the internet, but they are hard to find and search.

Many Usenet archives have been stored on archive.org, although spot checking some of these does not show any capture of quake groups.

A quake-specific archive of rec.games.computer.quake.announce for 1996 and 1997 is maintained at gamers.org called "The r.g.c.Quake Usenet postings archive".

	          The r.g.c.Quake Usenet postings archive
	          =======================================

	This archive contains the periodic postings and approved articles to
	Usenet group rec.games.computer.quake.announce, as well as documents
	describing the creation of the rec.games.computer.quake.* hierarchy.

-- [The r.g.c.Quake Usenet postings archive](https://www.gamers.org/pub/archives/quake/)

Spot checking the content of this archive shows the same messages are preserved and searchable via google.groups.com.

A benefit of this archive is that it can be downloaded and searched using alternate tools, like grep. Providing an alternative to google groups poor search interface.
