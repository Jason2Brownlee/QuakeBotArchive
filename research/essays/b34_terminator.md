# Terminator Bot

The **Terminator Bot** or "TERMINATOR" is a client-side Quake bot developed by Olivier Montanuy.

It is deathmatch assistant, rather than a deathmatch opponent, e.g. a helper bot.

## Early Versions

There may have been earlier public versions of the bot that are not currently know.

The bot was hosted on <http://www.ens.fr/~cridlig/bot/> which was not archived, meaning we have no record of releases that may have been present.

Olivier Montanuy was also involved in the QuakeC documentation project from an early stage.

For example:

> August 8th 1996
>
> Quake C Specs Updated\
> Up to version 3 now, by Olivier Montanuy, available, as always on the Quake C Page.

-- https://www.bluesnews.com/archives/august96.html

These were hosted on <http://www2.csn.net/~rudeseal/quakec/> and <http://www.sni.net/~rudeseal/quakec/> which may also have hosted early versions of the bot. Unfortunately, neither of these sites were archived.


## Version 0.7

Version 0.7 was mentioned via a link in the announcement of v0.8 on Blues News October 17th 1996 (see below)

## Version 0.8

Version 0.8 was mentioned on Blues News October 17th 1996:

> Client Side 'Bot II
>
> Joel Baxter, AKA lemurboy, wrote in to point out that the Terminator wasn't as I wrote, the first client-side 'bot, since AE_Playmate, and C/S Bot, came before it. D'oh! True enough, stories about each of these are actually buried in Blue's archives (BTW, gonna add a search feature soon). I had a bad day today (guess this is a good place to thank Matt Armistead for pointing out the six typos in one story and Jeff Borenstein for catching a bad link in another). While we're clearing the client 'bot air, there's also ZaphBot, based on C/S, born October 8, 1996. It does seem fair to say that the Terminator is probably the most advanced of these client 'bots (I'll wait for the corrections on that...). Here's the corrected story:
>
> The Terminator 'bot, the most advanced client-side 'bot to date, has been created by Olivier Montanuy (Thanks to Joost Schuur for letting me know). Client-side means no Quake C is required, it just connects to the game as a player. There are also commands that servers can use to disallow such 'bots. All in all, the kind of terrific effort we expect from Olivier. Here's the text file. You can also play in "proxy mode" where the 'bot connects to the game, and you connect to the 'bot, which allows the 'bot to govern some of your "reflexes." As Whaleboy of QuakeX points out:
>
>    "didja know what?? This BOT supports proxies!! In other words, I don't have to disconnect from my LAN and connect via modem on my main machine to play Quake anymore... I just put it on my server and away I go! :)"

## Version 0.9

Version 0.9 was mentioned on Blues News November 12th 1996:

> Terminator Updated
>
> There's a new version of Olivier Montanuy's cool client-side bot the Terminator. Client-side means that unlike QuakeC bots like the reaper, this bot doesn't need to be run off the server. It just logs into the game like an ordinary player. Here's the Terminator Bot Version 0.9. What's new:
Changes since version 0.8
>
> 	Not much, mostly bug fixes. The bug that plagged the Unix/Linux/WindozeNT version seems dead.  You can now customise the name and color of the bot, and in automatic mode, the bot will try to reconnect every minute (in case the server goes down).
>
> Thanks to Joe E. Powell for sending the word (yep he does stuff other than code QSpy... I even played him in QuakeWorld the other day!!).

## Version 0.91

Version 0.91 was mentioned on Blues News on December 27th 1996:

> Bot Mania
>
> Thanks to Jim "Howley" Rowley for the news that Cameron Newham has released his source code for the Eliminator Bot (124 KB) on his homepage. Also, while poking around for this, I noticed on the Terminator Bot Page that Olivier Montanuy has updated his client-side bot, the Terminator to version 0.91 (227 KB) here's the read me) which features bug fixes from version 0.9. Here's the source: zip (130 KB), or tar (114 KB).

Thankfully, the files were archived.

Interestingly, although the release is noted as v0.91, the filenames are for v0.90.

## Version 0.92

No information is known about this release, although it is speculated to exist given the existence of 0.91 and 0.93.


## Version 0.93

Version 0.93 was mentioned in text on Olivier Montanuy's personal webpage <http://perso.wanadoo.fr/montanuy/>:

> Changes since version 0.93
>
> I fixed a bug which prevented the bot to appear correctly in the list of quake servers. It actually appeared in the list, but using address 0.0.0.0 instead of it's real address, so your Quake client could not connect to it.
>
> I have provided some additional instructions for Windows 95 users, that should work also under Windows NT and Windows 98. But the recommended system for running the bot is Linux, since Windows is a TCP/IP nightmare.
>
> I have not modified the (rather stupid) AI of the bot. No time for this, sorry.
